All we had for a long time was the list of ingredients on the back of an old envelope.  We lost it for a good while and after I found it, I originally posted it so I would never lose it again.   Thank you all for all your interest ... this is my absolute favorite pie.  During the &quot;lost&quot; phase I must have gained 20 pounds trying numerous different buttermilk pie recipes ... I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.  I've noted a lot of people mentioning reducing the sugar, which is fine, but bear in mind that the sugar quantity was a major difference between this and other recipes I tested when it was lost. Hey, it is a PIE, it is SUPPOSED to be sweet.  Enjoy",

         "This recipe was originally noted by my wife on a cooking show on TV.  It was touted as an Amish recipe.  All we had for a long time was the list of ingredients on the back of an old envelope.  We lost it for a good while and after I found it, I originally posted it so I would never lose it again.   Thank you all for all your interest ... this is my absolute favorite pie.  During the &quot;lost&quot; phase I must have gained 20 pounds trying numerous different buttermilk pie recipes ... I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.  I've noted a lot of people mentioning reducing the sugar, which is fine, but bear in mind that the sugar quantity was a major difference between this and other recipes I tested when it was lost. Hey, it is a PIE, it is SUPPOSED to be sweet.  Enjoy",
