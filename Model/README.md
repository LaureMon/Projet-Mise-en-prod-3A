The goal of the preprocessing stage is to create a 10,000-recipe dataframe for our *frigo_vide* application. We combined two public Kaggle datasets and created new variables to provide filtering options for users. The final dataframe includes eight filters:

*  **Six binary filters (True/False):**
*1. **Vegetarian**
*2. **Beginner-Friendly**
* 3.  **Asian Cuisine**
* 4.  **African Cuisine**
* 5.  **North & South American Cuisine**
* 6.  **European & Eastern European Cuisine**

*  **Two categorical filters:**
* 7.  **Recipe Type** (Main Course, Dessert, Beverage, or Breakfast)
* 8.  **Total Time Range** (Under 30 minutes, Between 30 minutes and 1 hour, or Over 1 hour)
