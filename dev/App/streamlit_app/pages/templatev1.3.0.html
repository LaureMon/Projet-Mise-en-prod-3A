    File: templatev1.3.0.html
    Description: This is a test for the future main landing page of our streamlit application. 
                 It is meant to externalize successfully the styling of an html file called
                 via streamlit.
    Version: 1.3.0
    Notes:
    - It is called by the appv1.3.py python file.
    - The recipe data is dynamically updated through the python script calling it.
    (We use {{}} to call those parameters as we use Jinja2 in streamlit)
    - This file's styling is contained in a css file ('src/style_res.css') that is called 
    a dynamic data from python file in the <style> part.
    Note that it was not possible to call the css file the usual way due to streamlit restrictions.
