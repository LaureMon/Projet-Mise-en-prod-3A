# What to do with the ingredients left in my fridge?

Our application is composed of 3 pages:

## Homepage

*   A homepage with an image tutorial and a usage example to guide our users.

## Search Page

*   A search page with a search bar where you can search in two ways:
    *   **Search by title:** (e.g., pizza, burger, quiche, smoothie, cake).
    *   **Search by ingredients:** (e.g., egg, beef, strawberry). You can add multiple ingredients.

*   Several filters are available to customize recipes according to your preferences:
    *   **Quick and easy recipes:** No time to cook ? Activate the "Beginner friendly" recipes option and select recipes ready in less than an hour!
    *   **World Cuisine:** Do you feel like traveling? Choose the country you want to escape to with the "Choose a provenance" filter.
    *   **Vegetarian options:** Are you vegetarian? We've thought of you! Find plenty of varied and balanced recipes by activating the "Vegetarian recipes" option.

*   Finally, if you're unsure about "letuce" or "lettuce"—it happens to us too—we've integrated a spell checker so that even if you type "letuce," a suggestion appears below the search bar showing "Did you mean lettuce?"

## Recipe Page

*    Finally this printable recipe page provides all the information you need to prepare your best meal: preparation time, cooking time, ingredients, directions, ratings, nutrition facts, and a link to the original recipe page.
