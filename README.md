# What to do with the ingredients left in my fridge?

## Project overview 

This project is part of the "Infrastructure and software systems" course. The goal of this project is to develop a Streamlit application that helps users find recipes based on the ingredients they have in their fridge. By entering available ingredients and specifying preferences like preparation time, or recipe type, users can receive several recipe suggestions. 

## Features

Our application is composed of 3 pages:

- **Homepage**: A homepage with an image tutorial and a usage example to guide our users.
- **Search Page**:
  A search page with a search bar where you can search in two ways:
    *   **Search by title:** (e.g., pizza, burger, quiche, smoothie, cake).
    *   **Search by ingredients:** (e.g., egg, beef, strawberry). You can add multiple ingredients.

   Several filters are available to customize recipes according to your preferences:
    *   **Quick and easy recipes:** No time to cook ? Activate the "Beginner friendly" recipes option and select recipes ready in less than an hour!
    *   **World Cuisine:** Do you feel like traveling? Choose the country you want to escape to with the "Choose a provenance" filter.
    *   **Vegetarian options:** Are you vegetarian? We've thought of you! Find plenty of varied and balanced recipes by activating the "Vegetarian recipes" option.

   Finally, if you're unsure about "letuce" or "lettuce"—it happens to us too—we've integrated a spell checker so that even if you type "letuce," a suggestion appears below the search bar showing "Did you mean lettuce?"

- **Recipe Page**: Finally this printable recipe page provides all the information you need to prepare your best meal: preparation time, cooking time, ingredients, directions, ratings, nutrition facts, and a link to the original recipe page.
