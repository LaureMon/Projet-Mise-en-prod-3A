I served it with tortilla chips and fresh veggies for dipping.  I also made a second batch and mixed it 1:1 with ranch dressing and used it as a tex-mex salad dressing.

82343,89626,35889,35701,ciao4293,3,"I was very eager to try these, and was not disappointed with how easy they were to prepare, how fast the dough was ready for shaping, then baking.  But I'm sorry to say the flavor was just not there.  I guess my family is used to more flavorful breads.  Maybe they need more salt, I'm not sure.  They had a good texture, but they didn't go over very well with us.  I'm guessing they would make a good sandwich roll, with other flavors in the mix, but as a dinner roll, I didn't think they had enough flavor to stand on their own.  Sorry.

61592,67892,49423,91166,TinaSue,5,this is one of my favorites.  Only thing different I did was add a can of peas to the mix.  Ooooo and I cover it with shredded cheddar cheese instead of velveeta.  I keep one of these in the freezer made up to the cook point all the time so it can just be popped in the over and yummmmmmm,2003-09-17T15:28:40Z,2003-09-17T15:28:40Z

However it is a good recipe that does the job perfectly. It frees up the stove, gets rid of the stirring and gives you a great result. Can't ask for much more than that!

I substituted sugar snap peas and Niblets corn for the squash- not because we don't like squash but because that is what I had on hand. It was fast, colorful, and delicious.

84500,91899,30522,58931,Linorama,5,"Impossible, but true!  They are easy to make and taste fantastic.  I didn't have a whole cup of seasoned bread crumbs so supplemented with plain, used a powdered egg replacer, and added a little black pepper and extra Old Bay to my mix.  I didn't have any trouble forming the patties with floured hands though I did handle them lightly.  They cooked up a gorgeous color and went great with roasted broccoli for dinner.  I made 6 patties but think I will make 8-10 next time to keep the size down and make them more crispy.  Thanks for a new mainstay recipe in our house!",2004-03-05T18:12:31Z,2004-03-05T18:12:31Z

Tapas actually translates to 'covers'. It originated by some bright spark deciding that a good way of keeping the flies out of the sherry was to cover the copa (cup) with a thin slice of bread. Someone else decide it was a waste to throw the bread away afterwards and put toppings on the bread to be eaten after the drink. And so - TAPAS !!",2002-05-16T10:47:14Z,2002-05-16T10:47:14Z

I normally substitute something else for ginger in recipes, but I couldn't think of something else to use that wouldn't upset the delicate balance of this salad, so I just omitted it. I did toast the sesame seeds, though, and tossed in a little scallion.

Then I discovered when rolling them up that if I put a thin layer of beans all over the tortilla, then a layer of cheese on only half of it, but then roll it cheese half first, the cheese gets pushed along, the whole thing gets filled, but you have a firmer roll that is easier to cut.

Nice healthy muffin for my little ones.....though I did throw in a handful each of chocolate & peanut butter chips because I happened to have them for a little treat! Maybe it was just my particular oven??...... but my toothpick was coming out pretty clean at around 13 minutes!!!!!!!and I probably took them out I think it was around 14/15 minutes. 20 minutes would have been too long in my case, so you may want to watch the cooking time. I found these to be better on the second day. Good muffin,thanks Donna!",2004-01-31T06:20:18Z,2004-01-31T06:20:18Z

I did not have cilanto so I substitued a pinch of dried tarragon because we like that taste.  I also did not use alfalfa sprouts and replaced English with regular cucumbers.  The mix of the sweet with the tart and spicy is incredible.  I will make this over and over.,2004-01-25T11:34:23Z,2004-01-25T11:34:23Z

I've never used a candy thermometer, and neither has my mom, so I can't tell you what temperature it must reach, but it's important that you stir continuously and that the mixture starts to leave the sides of the pan... you WILL be able to tell by looking. Here in hot, humid India, it might be 15 minutes, but it could take longer in cooler places.

I also substituted the yellow squash with 1 medium-sized yellow bell pepper. I omitted the zucchini and dried basil as I didn't have those on hand. Also, since we're all overweight in the family and fighting the bulge, I didn't top it with parmesan cheese at the end. What I really liked was that this soup used all fresh veggies, tomatoes(really good, worked like the winning ingredient here!) and black pepper. Black pepper does enhance the taste of this soup tremendously. My mom in particular says THANK YOU to YOU for this recipe(She's been suffering a bad cold for a long time now and is just getting better since yesterday). This makes a real huge quantity - There were 5 of us who had this for dinner tonight and we still have a serving or two in the pot.

I also cut the breasts in half lengthwise to maximize penetration of seasonings *tsd* I sprinkled a little cheddar on top as well.

I must admit I am being a little hard on karen.  The benchmark for her recipes are always outstanding, and I am one of her biggest fan.  And the reason why i am rating it 4 instead of 5 star is because, I found the glaze a little too much trouble for the actual outcome of the cake.  Overall the cake is extremely simple to make, and it taste really good, BUT the glaze really was not worth that much of effort or time.  Next time, i will just melt a little bit of chocolate and drizzle it on, OR just use some hershey chocolate sauce.  It would work just as well, and eating the cake, you can't really tell the difference if you had just used a chocolate sauce.

I will always make it this way, as the resulting texture and amount was perfect.  The only other comment has nothing to do with the dip itself, but the choice of scooper.  I adore Fritos, but I found their saltiness overwhelmed the flavor of the dip.  I much prefer using an organic, lower-salt tortilla chip as it really lets the dip's flavor shine.

There were definitely a couple of things about this recipe - first of all, do not use a mixer.  I used a handmixer and it got so thick I wound up using a wooden spoon to finish mixing the batter. Also, I rolled the cookies in the sugar, but it just seemed to be absorbed into the cookie, so I had to dust the cookies again after they came out of the oven.  Finally, watch these cookies!  When they are overcooked they become very stiff and dry.

I've avoided using red cabbage in slaws ever since years ago when I made a slaw that the color bled out of turning it into an unappetizing 'pink', so I was a little leary about this one.  I saw some raving comments on the boards about it and decided I would try it anyway as I had a small head of red cabbage that I needed to use.  My family really enjoyed it, with the exception of the youngest 'picky eater' who wouldn't even try it--so she doesn't get to have any say in the rating. ;-)  We ate this for dinner after having stood for about 3-4 hours and thought it would benefit from sitting longer.

I made the bread again today. Again, the dough seemed to be a little dry, so I added a tablespoon of milk and a tablespoon of olive juice/brine to the dough. That seemed to help. The bread looked nicer when it came out of the oven and seemed to be lighter. It is  tastier this time around too. Not sure what the difference is. I used unbleached flour. Not sure if that made a difference or not. I think next time I make this bread, I will add the extra tablespoon of milk and olive juice to the egg mixture so that I won't have to mix it as much.

Maybe it should be finished in the oven, uncovered, to let the broth reduce?  I love cheese of all kinds, but this was an indignity to cheddar!  It curdled when left to simmer.

No wonder i had so much left over, sorry Michelle your recipe is perfect as is.  This cake was awesome!!  Extremely moist, and full of strawberry flavor.  When spreading the strawberries on top of the cake let the fruit soak in on its own. I know it's tempting to get a spoon and try to guide the fruit into the holes, but don't do it you will only end up covering the holes (which is what i did). I used the icing recipe from #75591 What a great icing especially for this cake. Because it was a special occasion I decorated the top of the cake with chocolate covered strawberries, this made such an elegant and professional display. I hope you are as pleased with this cake as me and my hosts were. I took this cake to a friends house for dessert, NONE LEFT and 5 DEMANDS for the recipe.

When the woman received her credit card statement she was shocked to see that the charge from the restaurant was $250 bucks.

We had around 10 people come home for Shawarma and dinner. I had marinated the chicken in the marinade day before y'day(total marination time of an exact 24 hours which did it real good as I was complimented saying that it tasted excellent!). The only ingredient I didn't have at home was 'mace', so, I omitted that. I added a pinch of red food colour to the marinade(I always do this whenever making anything on the grill mode in my oven to give it that red colour appearance). I used 1 1/2 tsps. salt in the marinade mixture. I preheated my oven at 250C for 22 minutes 50 seconds and then grilled the chicken in it. It needed a little more grilling as it was still a little pink, so, I grilled for an additional 8 minutes. My house smelt like a professional tandoor joint :)
The tahini dip was unfortunately not enjoyed by anyone. I served the grilled chicken with khaboos and it was gone in seconds! Some of the guys said they enjoyed pouring lemon juice on the grilled chicken and then chowing it down :)

The first time I made it I ate it as it was. The second time I used it as a base and topped it with a Thai inspired pork stir fry. Both times tasty beyond belief!

The caramel sauce I would try cream instead of water. I also think cardamon and cinnamon would have seasoned the cheese filling nicely.Maybe adding sundried berries. This does come out to be a firm dish so don`t fret when you see how thin the batter is. Oh and this makes a lot more then 8 servings so if you are worried about diet it`s not as bad as you think.

These looked just like coffeehouse muffins but tasted much better.  Note: Make sure you grease & flour the muffin tins very well - including the top of the pan, as the when making muffins, the tops grow over the sides a big (to create that great coffehouse look)and they can be tricky to remove.

I thawed the meat out in the fridge overnight & put this together Sunday morning. I figured that it would ""work"" since I'd made no-boil lasagna in the oven before, but I'd never been happy with that - the noodles got all crusty on the edges. Not so with this! Noodles all cooked perfectly. The only problem we had was it turned out just a bit ""soupy"" so we just left the lid off for about an hour before serving, and it was great. Perhaps my sauce was a bit thinner than yours? Next time I might reduce or leave out the water, and see what happens. WONDERFUL idea, this one, and we WILL make it again. And again.

It fed 2 and a half people and there is plenty left over for lunch for tomorrow, but that's probably because of all the greens I used and I tend to err on the generous side.

These are fabulous ginger cookies! They were a great hit this weekend at camp.  Saturday was nippy and cold and we had a lot of company. Rack after rack of these cookies disappeared as soon as they out of the oven.  The sweetened consensed milk, three tablespoons of ground ginger and 3/4 c. crystallized ginger presented the only downside of this recipe..i.e. expense. However, I will be sure to make this recipe again for special occassions. Thanks for posting!

Actually, my 3yo DD made it herself (adult supervision for the flame) stirring the semi-sweet chocolate, milk, and butter to melting in the fondue pot.  We helped her with the measuring, and it came out perfectly.  Once the chocolate was melted, even at it's lowest flame, the fondue pot kept the chocolate almost at a simmer, so we turned off the flame.  We dunked in honey castella cake, fresh strawberries, orange sections, marshmallows, and bananas.  The chocolate was the perfect eating temperature and the flavor was excellent.

75206,82160,66106,86318,mianbao,2,"I chose this recipe for the Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup game. The first stumbling block was the amounts of baking powder and baking soda. Having experienced an overdose of these in a different (non-Zaar) recipe, I tend to be careful. I cut the amounts in half, and that was plenty of leavening. If that were the only problem, I would not be rating these so low. I also cut the amounts of spices in half, but kept the the recipe's proportions. However, with this recipe's proportions, the more strongly flavored cloves and allspice overpower the cinnamon and nutmeg. The batter was also quite thin. After baking the first batch I added 1 cup flour. The cookies now appear very nice, and have a nice texture, but they are still strongly flavored with cloves, and we actually would have preferred raisins in them over the chocolate chips. 
Added to say, I am happy to see that the recipe poster has changed the amount of baking powder from 1 tablespoon to 1 teaspoon. As individual preferences for spices vary greatly, I'm sure that there will be those who appreciate this recipe.",2004-01-14T06:59:54Z,2004-01-14T06:59:54Z

10182,13289,22896,28846,Caryn,4,What a nice tasty potato dish; very simple yet flavorful.  Sort of similiar to mashed potatoes but in chunks - great that alot of the flavor comes from the beef broth so that it isn't necessary to use alot of butter and milk (like you would in traditional mashed potatoes).  I ended up peeling my potatoes due to one picky family member but won't bother next time as it will make the dish quick and easy.  The one thing I did discover is that I needed to add an extra cup (3 to 4 cups) or so of beef broth because my 3 large potatoes must have been on the larger side.

The marinade is actually quite tasty - I think an overnight soak in the marinade would be more helpful.  I marinated my steaks for 1 hour and stillthought they could have stood more time.  The directions are a little vague - I was unclear what cut of meat to use and finally decided upon sirloin steaks cut about 1/2"" thick.  I didn't care for the pan frying method - I would recommend grilling the meat rather than the panfrying.  I thought the amount of oil was way too much - I didn't need to add the extra 2 Tbsp. of oil when cooking the onions.  I might make this again, but only with lots of alterations.",2002-01-17T14:59:59Z,2002-01-17T14:59:59Z

62863,69217,57652,35965,Cindy Lynn,5,"I made this twice as one of our Zaar Tag participants had tagged it and it turned out bitter.  Upon comparing the recipe to one of my own, I suspected the ingredient 'corn syrup' was a different ingredient where Mae lived than here in the USA.  Mae kindly provided a list of the ingredients on her corn syrup and I found that list comparable to 'industrial' corn syrups in the USA rather than consumer (home cooking) ingredient lists.  Since my dad use to haul corn syrup to factories, he had given me a supply of 'industrial' corn syrup, which is extremely sweet compared to Karo corn syrup.

As with the original tagger, using Karo, the syrup turned out very bitter, definitely not sweet, but I was able to modify it to turn it into fudge.  When I used the 'industrial' version of corn syrup, it turned out so well we were eating it with a spoon! :-)  The main difference between the two is that industrial corn syrup is almost entirely 'fructose', so anyone in the USA making this recipe will want to look for a liquid fructose (rather than powder) to use in this rather than Karo or its alternative brands.
Mae, thank you for this learning experience and for finally giving me something I can use this 'corn syrup' in without it turning out overpoweringly sweet...before this, I had not been able to come up with good ratios for this intensely sweet product.",2003-09-29T04:03:19Z,2003-09-29T04:03:19Z

(Maybe it's a Southern thing, like Banana and Mayonnaise sandwiches, which must be served on the whitest bread you can find!) I hope more people give Tomato Sandwiches a shot..don't forget the cheese!

8417,11397,17943,30954,Brave Noodle njg,4,"alright.  nj ""newbie"" here.  known for my devotion for peanut butter, could not keep this recipe in my cookbook for too long without giving it a try.

first - that silly cross pattern with the fork
tip:  continually rinse off your fork with warm water ever 2 cookies or so, or it will stick and lose that wonderful pattern in a mush of pulled up dough

second - i made my cookies enormous (i only rolled 18).  
tip:  trust me, the WILL expand.  they don't look like it, but they do.  make real spoonfuls, not shovelfuls. 

third - if you are crazy and want enormous cookies, reduce the oven to 300.
tip:  plan an activity to do, these will take longer to cook.  the smell of peanut butter will taunt you.  if you don't keep yourself busy you will be glaring at the oven for 15+ minutes trying to cook them faster with your soul, and it didn't work for me.

fourth - good news!
tip:  the cookies will harden when out of the oven, so you can be slightly impatient and take them out a little early to maintain a soft chewy cookie!  yay!  (maybe the soul glare worked?)

fifth - additions
i agree with other reviews, these cookies would rock even more with other goodies in them like peanut butter chips or oatmeal - i'm going to try that next!",2002-04-03T17:52:40Z,2002-04-03T17:52:40Z

I also added the italian ssng to the the ricotta mixture. End results still could have had more though. My problem is....I'm trying to find a lasagna that I had when I was a kid at my parents friends house.Haven't found it yet...but I still give this one 4 stars.

Jailhouse Doughnuts would have rated a full five from me based on taste, but the instructions could be a little more explicit so I chose a 4-star rating. The proportions of milk to egg were fine; I believe any less milk would result in too eggy a concoction. I lightly dipped each ""sandwich"" in the egg mixture, then slipped them into several inches of hot oil (375F) and deepfried for 2 mins per side; then placed them on paper towels to drain. They were quite crispy on the outside, and quite jammy (I used blueberry) on the inside; they did not remind me of french toast at all. They made for a lovely treat; I just wish they ""looked"" less like sandwiches :-) Perhaps a different cutting method would help. I believe the trick here is having enough deepfrying oil in your pot, and making sure it is at at least 375F before adding each new batch. Also, don't undercook; the one batch I specifically undercooked (at only 1 minute per side) was edible, but definitely not as good as the ones fried longer.",2002-01-24T17:04:56Z,2002-01-24T17:04:56Z

Sooooo, I decided to cut into serving pieces and roll up.  I had a box of corn bread stove top stuffing so I figured as long as I was rolling the steaks I would fix the stuffing and roll some in the steaks.  Also I sauted some sliced fresh musrooms and added them to the sauce.  I didn't have broccoli soup so used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic.  And I threw in some fresh cauliflour.  After I added the wine I was concerned about the flavor being too strong but it wasn't.  Everything blended in beautifully and I served over rice.  It was double delicious.  Thanks for the recipe and I hope you don't mind about the changes.  lol  ",2004-05-08T16:50:02Z,2004-05-08T16:50:02Z

The only thing I will do differently next time is put it on a rack over the water, and use a meat thermometer to determine when it's done.  45 minutes was too long for 2 one-pound tenderloins, and I think cooking it in the water causes it to lose some of the flavor.

The recipe calls for 12 teaspoons of almond extract and should problably be 1/2 teaspoon. I used 1 teaspoon and felt it was a little strong.  Was hard to tell when they were done. I checked the first batch in 5 minutes and they did not look done to me so left them in a minute or so longer and they burned.  I did better with with the rest and it seems that 5 1/2 minutes worked fine.  It took me over an hour to prepare (but that may be my fault)  They do taste good and look beautiful.

I didn't even need to add salt or pepper to the sauce! Erin, this recipe is a real keeper; very easy and very delicious!",2002-03-27T13:24:07Z,2002-03-27T13:24:07Z

46381,51768,38056,30534,Lorac,4,"This easy recipe turned out exactly as I hoped it would. I had a craving for chicken that tasted like chicken and rice with a dominant chicken flavor, no sauce, herbs or spices. Just old fashion simple cooking. This was ""simply"" wonderful. The amount of butter was a bit decadent but combined with the other ingredients and chicken juices - well, there were only 2 of us and most of the rice disappeared.
I used boneless, skinless chicken  breasts and the only changes I made were the result of feeblemindness. After adding the broth, I realized that I had used a ""parboiled"" rice and resigned my self to having mush at the end of the cooking time. I was so upset with myself that I forgot the cover. The good news, after one hour, I had perfectly cooked rice with a roasted chicken flavor. Next time I will use skin on bone in chicken for even more flavor and I will try to pay attention to what I am doing. Thanks Tweeky, it's a keeper.",2003-05-08T17:35:24Z,2003-05-08T17:35:24Z

My personal adjustments, which in no way affect the original recipe....I needed more bacon (guess mine was too lean) to get enough drippings.  I thinly sliced my onion instead of chopping it.  I simmered mine for 30 minutes instead of 15, but that is a personal preference as I like the kernals softer, more like a creamed corn. I also put the crumbled cooked bacon back into it.  Thanks Bev, I am going to the store tomorrow and buying lots of more corn, they are 20 cents each and making a ton of this to freeze and have when corn is not as plentiful.  I LOVE this recipe.

Now here is where I made a change to suit our preference.  I used 2 cups of the crumb & nut mixture and added 1/3 cup of melted butter to make a vanilla wafer crumb crust.  Pressed it to the bottom of an 8 X 11 pyrex cake pan and baked it at 375 degrees for 8 minutes.

The cake does remind me of apple dumplings without all of the work of making them.  I actually shared this with my brother because he loves apple dumplings so much.  He gave it a 5 thumbs up, and asked me to give the recipe to my SIL.  So, I guess they will be making it again, and so will I.

61654,67955,69052,6357,Charishma_Ramchanda,4,"I made a very special lunch for my family today afternoon. This was a special part of it. I cut down the oil to only 1 tbsp(as a personal preference, I like less oily food - the lesser the better, I believe). I used 1/2 tsp. of red chilli powder and also 1/2 tsp. of black pepper powder(the latter was a substitute for sugar as a personal preference since we like slightly spicer food). I used mustard seeds instead of dry mustard. I added 1/2 a cup of water in step 8. Like I usually cook, here again for this recipe, I first heated oil in the skillet, then added the mustard and cumin seeds. After they stopped spluttering, I added the onions with a with few drops of water and allowed them to brown until they were medium-browned. Then, I added the turmeric, red chilli and black pepper powders, mixed it all well, and then after 2 minutes, I added in the tomatoes. I allowed them to cook, stirring every so often, until the tomatoes were softened. Then, I added the salt, mixed it well, and tossed in the cauliflower florets and the water to cook these. I mixed it all well, covered and allowed it to cook for about 25 minutes. Before serving, I garnished this dish with some fresh finely chopped corriander leaves. I served this hot with rotis. I also had some of it with rice and it tastes very good. A nice masala rice(with a hint of lemon yellow colour)and some plain chilled yoghurt/ a spiced raita and a glass of Lassi will complete this meal most beautifully.

I think roasting the garlic is the way to go, and if blanching, blanch for more than one minute (3? perhaps).  And (confession time) I added 4 T of white wine vinegar instead of 4 tsp by mistake.  No problem, thankfully. : )  I also packed my 1/4 cup full of basil and went for the full 1/4 tsp cayenne.  Thank you for another keeper!  It's a great one to make for last minute guests, too.

I sauted fresh mushrooms before adding to the sauce.  I added a little freshly grated nutmeg to the cottage cheese mixture, as well as an egg. On the top layer I added parmesan with the mozzarella, and I used extra-lean ground beef and low fat cottage cheese and part skim mozzarella.  In the end it was slightly watery, but nothing to complain about.  My kids who usually can't cut lasagna noodles, gobbled this down.

They were not big enough to get in any filling and close the tops so I just turned up the sides and pinched the corners to make triangles.  However, on some of them, the sides fell during cooking so they aren't the best-looking hamentashen.  Still taste fine though.  Next time, I will make them bigger.

I laid out 2 pieces of fresh italian bread.  On both sides I put the salsa, and added a combo of grated american/pepperjack cheese.  On one side I placed thinly sliced red onions and cherry tomatoes, and on the other side a sizzling row of Trappey's jalapeno slices (the best in the world).  I stuck it all together and toasted it in the oven.  10 minutes later, I had a rather interesting looking sandwich sitting in front of me.
The flavor was, well, good.  But it was very, very messy:  each bite sent salsa squirting every which way. While it filled my gnawing hunger, it didn't last too long.  I was *starving* 2 hours later!

This would probably be really good with a tortilla shell.  The bread just doesn't make a great holder for salsa.

What a difference it made to have the ingredients and instructions made clear by the author. We wound up making 2 more batches because it was so good and easy to make, and it got used as follows: (1) pizza crust for homemade pizza; (2) the dough ingredient in Chef ChrissyO’s Sausage Bread Roll for doggies (that would be me) - her recipe is ID # 28379; and (3) rounded into small individual focaccia breads, which were topped with caramelized onions, chopped tomatoes, chopped artichoke hearts, minced garlic, chopped olives, fresh rosemary, and ground black pepper. As a result of the voracious consumption of these three goodies that subsequently occurred in our household, it is necessary and just to change the words “heavy and chewy” in the previous review to “airy, delicious and extremely versatile” in this review. And, without hesitation or reservation, to upgrade the rating from 2 stars to 5.",2002-09-30T02:57:14Z,2002-09-30T02:57:14Z

Tip for future makers: make sure you have a bowl big enough for 8 lbs. of goo, or you will have to divide and conquer, which makes it harder to incorporate the dry stuff (seeds and nuts).

The men in the  family were alittle sceptical about the ingredients but once it was cooked it was delicious.  I did make a few adjustments though.  I added two beef boulion cubes, plus a good sprinkling of garlic.  I didn't use as much sugar, just a teaspoon.  I also added a couple drops of gravy master.  We put this on steamed rolls as suggested and it was gone in one sitting.  We all loved it.  Thanks for sharing.",2004-05-31T08:03:08Z,2004-05-31T08:03:08Z

I made 1/3 recipe and substituted butter for margarine, and used a bit more vanilla than was called for. I followed the usual cookie recipe method: creamed butter and sugars, added egg, mixed, then vanilla, mixed, then the ground oatmeal (measure first, then grind) and flour along with the baking powder and baking soda, mixed, then folded in the chocolate chunks. I used a 1 inch cookie scoop and got 36 cookies from the 1/3 recipe. The ideal baking time was just under 8 minutes - you really must be careful not to overbake these as they seem to lose some of their taste when baked crunchy. When the edges are *just* beginning to brown, hurry up and get them out! I allowed the cookies to cool on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

48684,54177,63301,68460,Hey Jude,4,"I did try this with 1 cut-up fryer-chicken!  The glaze is really good, what a nice flavor....I had a little bit of a problem with technique.  I sprinkled the chicken with the pepper, salt, chili powder and garlic powder, then placed it on the grill, I let it cook on indirect heat for about 10 minutes before putting on the glaze.  I couldn't 'brush' it on the meat without wiping off the previously applied spices, you have to kind of 'dab' the glaze onto the chicken.  Also, the amounts called for the glaze would be enough for about 3 chickens and, most likely 2-3 turkey breasts.  

I'm going to make this again because the flavor of the glaze was terrific, I'll just adjust the technique a bit and halve the recipe for the glaze (if I'm only doing 1-2 chickens)",2003-06-04T19:34:11Z,2003-06-04T19:34:11Z

I order smothered cheese fries all the time in restaurants and always dip them in ranch dressing. But the cooked ranch was just not for me, which I think is very weird.

MAKE SURE YOU LET THE COCONUT FILLING COOL COMPLETELY BEFORE PUTTING IN ON THE CAKE!!!!!! Unfortunately right after I mixed it, I put it on the bottom layer, topped it with the other layer and proceeded to frost it with the chocolate frosting. The coconut layer is at least an inch thick! As soon as I started to frost the sides, the chocolate frosting would not stick to the coconut filling, it all mixed together and the coconut was oozing all over the place! To save it, I put it right in the fridge. After about an hour, I took it out and kind of slopped the sides back together. Some of the frosting was mixed with coconut and had a bumpy consistency. I put it back in the fridge and then when it was set, I frosted over the bumby parts with the remaining frosting. I will check back with a rating after I actually get to taste it. I did taste some of the filling mixed with frosted that plopped onto the plate and that was yummy :)

25196,29504,4627,58720,Amber Robinson,5,"SUPERB Tortilla Soup!  We loved it.  My sister made it for a baby shower and we all wanted the recipe.  I made it this week with a few changes.  Instead of 10 tortillas I used 8 and I substituted the milk for Half & Half which somebody else had suggested.  It was really yummy, great flavor, but a little to much taco seasoning.  I love spicy, but next time I'll probably cut the taco seasoning down to (3) 1.25 oz packets.  Since it was much to spicy with the 6 oz I added approximately 2 1/2 cups more of Half & Half to dilute the spice, which turned out good and thick still.  We'll be making this for years to come.",2002-10-28T10:52:27Z,2002-10-28T10:52:27Z

50895,56497,64409,6357,Charishma_Ramchanda,4,"From the day you posted this recipe, I was really excited about trying this because it did not call for even one drop of oil(fat)!Finally, I cooked these mushrooms for lunch today and they were very good! I did make a few changes, though. Since I was the only one eating, I used 1 cup of sliced mushrooms(tinned), the juice of 1 orange(which was slightly below 1/2 cup), 1/4 tsp. ginger(freshly grated), 1/4 tsp. garlic(chopped), 1/4 tsp. black pepper, a little less than 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tbsp. soy sauce. I had a bit of a problem initially(I had to make this twice to get it right). Actually, after stirring in everything together in a bowl(other than ginger, garlic and the mushrooms, ofcourse), I added the mixture to the hot skillet. Within seconds, my skillet had black burning marks at the base and fumes going up, and my kitchen smelt like it was on fire. That's when I realised that this recipe could do with an additional step - please do mention that since there is no oil to saute the ginger and garlic, one could first just add the ginger and garlic to the hot skillet, and then add the mushrooms and NOT the juice of the orange-soy sauce mixture or it burns and leaves a horrible smelling black sauce that looks totally disgusting and smells even worse. I think this is a very important step. Done this way, it all works out fine. I would also like to mention here that I did not let the gravy completely dry out. I let some remain. The blend of flavours was really exceptional in these mushrooms - simply fantastic! I enjoyed this on its own and will make it again!",2003-06-21T04:59:46Z,2003-06-21T04:59:46Z

This is the third time that I have made this wonderful appetizer - this time I used a bit more brie and again used a full pkg of Puff Pastry (295 gram)  The brie, even when soft, is a bit difficult to spread  so I chop it in little bits and distribute it evenly -  My friends ALL enjoy this recipe5 Aug 06

As you said people will think you spent hours preparing this wonderful appeitizer - I knew we would like it so I doubled the recipe - I used a 295 gram pkg of puff pastry (this is the size that has 2 blocks in it.), 3 good sized onions, 3 tbsps of brown sugar, 1 tsp rice wine vinegar,Two 175Gram of Camembert - be generous with the caraway. I have 3 dozen   going into my freezer.  It is so easy, so attractive and so good Thanks Keen5 â€” Added comments - I made these again and this time I left them slightly under baked so when they are defrosted and baked they will be a perfect color.

I served them with a delicious warm salsa with black beans, and some shredded cheese and it was a nice twist for waffles. I think I would have preferred them with a little less corn (and I think less butter, maybe I'll use 1/4c safflower oil next time), but they are pretty good as is. Also, I think its important to mention that when adding the whites to the batter, it is very important that one knows to just fold them in, and not stir or mix them through/thoroughly, else the waffles will not come out as they are intended to.

Now, gyoza is a japanese adaptation of the chinese Kao-Tien/Pekinese fried ""raviolis"". In Japan, they usually put some garlic or garlic leaves whereas in china they don't.
Heat your pan hot before frying your gyoza so that the bottom will be crispy and the top soft. Beef seems better suited for deep-fried gyoza since it gets dry at cooking.

98688,106789,57388,103380,cookiebaker,5,I'm wondering why this fantastic recipe doesn't have more reviews! This is that restaurant teriyaki taste I have been searching for everytime I pick up a new bottle of sauce at the market or buy a new cookbook. And this recipe is the simplest sauce yet! I tried to follow the recipe to a T but when I went to Costco I forgot to buy salmon so I used the striper my hubbie caught yesterday. He filleted them and I proceeded with the recipe except I couldn't find the Sherry but no matter this recipe turned out great. Thanks Kimke because I now have the right recipe and next time I make it I will make with salmon.,2004-06-06T19:57:39Z,2004-06-06T19:57:39Z

One word of caution, and this was entirely MY fault.  Follow step 4 and don't have your mixture too thick.  I didn't thin the mixture like I should have and the filling was a little denser than they should have been.  BUT!, the peppers were still delicious.

89540,97196,87575,95743,sugarpea,0,Checked out Tiger Sauce and decided it was very similar to a hot sauce I had on hand.  The vegetable seasoning is not available locally so I used another that I also had on hand.  The results were disappointing so I recommend you stick with the exact marinade and make no substitutions.,2004-04-06T23:57:14Z,2004-04-06T23:57:14Z
72903,79737,54961,26719,Cathy17,4,"This was very good and gave the meat a tangy taste.  The first time I made it for deer steaks and the second time was for a pork loin roast.   Both times, I substituted pure Quebec maple syrup (nothing beats Canadian maple syrup!) for the honey, red wine vinegar instead of plain,  about 3 heaping tsps of minced garlic (we love garlic) and I cut the amount of oil considerably.  I also used alot of ground ginger for a more pungeant taste.  I've never been one to measure these things because I find most recipes understate spices for our taste, so I always adjust them to personal taste levels.   As for the soy sauce, the recipe as is makes it quite salty tasting, so I had to add quite a bit of vinegar and maple syrup to balance it off.  If you're making the receipe as is (and not using my free for all spice additions), I would cut the soy sauce by half if you don't like a salty taste. I marinated the deer steaks for a few hours and per hubby's request, fried them in my teflon electric skillet.  Very good, but I didn't marinate them long enough.

When I made it for the pork loin roast, I put it in a ziploc bag and marinated for about 24 hours, shaking the bag often because of the oil separating.  I glazed some of it over the roast before I put it in the oven and basted several times with the remainder as it was cooking. IT WAS SO YUMMY and had a very tangy flavor. The garlic chunks baked into the top of the meat - WOW!  Very yummy!

This is now my standard marinade because it worked on deer meat and pork, so I'm sure it will be great on steak.  I think I'll even try it on chicken and substitute white wine vinegar for that, keeping the rest of the recipe the same.  This is a definite keeper!  ",2003-12-17T12:27:24Z,2003-12-17T12:27:24Z

The orange zest really adds to the sauce.  I used my microplane zester.  Also, I added a whole onion, because I love them.  If your crockpot tends to cook quickly you may want to use a frozen brisket rather than a thawed one or cut an hour or so off the cooking time.  My brisket cooked really fast.  Also, if you cannot have or do not like salty foods you may want to use lower sodium teriyaki sauce or dillude the sauce with some water.  I promise the recipe will still be delicious if you make it with a low sodium diet/taste in mind.    ",2004-02-13T10:42:47Z,2004-02-13T10:42:47Z

I only had one can of cream of mushroom, so I just mixed in a little coffee cream, and it was perfectly rich.  Adding onions was definetly a good idea.

But my brother wanted spaghetti for dinner, so I decided to see if it was better if I made my own sauce!  Boy was it ever!  I could eat lots of spaghetti with this delicious sauce!  I agreed with Dan'l that it was a very good balance, where the meat wasn't overwhelming, but was a perfect combo.  I also added pepper flakes like JJBurns for a little spice.  And instead of using beef, I used leftover ground buffalo that we had in the freezer.  Delicioso!

34863,39680,51059,6357,Charishma_Ramchanda,5,"Really divine! I made this this evening for my dad to enjoy after dinner tonight. This makes about 2 servings and NOT 4-6! I omitted the dates and orange rind totally as I don't like either. I used 2 1/2 tbsps. of honey, a little more than 1/4 tsp. of essence, 2 tbsps. less than 1/2 a cup of orange juice, 1/3 cup Basmati rice, 1/2 cup raisins and 2 cups of low-fat milk. All throughout I had the wrong picture in my mind that once baked this would have become golden brown and have a crust like appearance. When I baked it in the oven(which I'd pre-heated to 160C) for 10 minutes, I failed to see the crust like pic which I'd had in my mind, and I baked it for another 10 minutes and thereafter for another 10 ! So, in total, I baked it for 35 minutes! No wonder my house is smelling so orangey and mmmmm, lovely!:)
I also loved the taste of raisins in this, loved biting the bloated raisin:)
A tip I'd like to share with everyone is when you add the rice to the boiling milk(step 2), if you are short on time and want it to cook faster, partially cover your saucepan(I do this everytime I cook rice). It really works! Next time, I'll be adding a few strands of saffron in step 1, i.e., while boiling the milk, for auntenticity(really Indian). Another thing, I did grease my ovenproof dish with margarine before putting in the mixture into it for baking. I enjoyed this warm and I think it's better served that way, but, to each his own!

I added some tomato sauce, basil, red wine, salt and pepper prior to simmering.  I used real olive oil, rather than the spray when preparing the eggplant, and peeled it prior to slicing (I think that the skin is tough.).  I mixed a bit of shredded mozzarella cheese with the sour cream and omitted the egg.  The end result was a very tasty dish.

Very easy to make, most likely up there with the nicest white loafs you will ever get from your bread maker… light, fluffy really tasty with a bite that the yoghurt gives it (by the way add a little more, go to 2/3 a cup.

As for it being sour dough… I’m not sure. I live in the UK and sour dough bread is one of the things I love most about visiting the east coast of the US, and I’m afraid this loaf just doesn’t cut it on those stakes (sorry about the pun), I’ve yet to try one involving the full ‘starter’ but that’s the next move… 

Please don’t let this put you off, it’s a fantastic loaf, and toasts just like sour dough bread, give it a try, I’m sure you’ll agree…

19517,23282,4809,53366,Ambassadress of Goo,0,"My teenage daughter was in tears about 5 minutes after she began preparing this recipe. The directions are highly unclear; making the assumption that all cooks already know how to assemble a Boston Cream Cake.  My 15 year old daughter began by adding all the first 5 ingredients together in a mixing bowl (an understandable mistake when you read the directions). What a mess!  The batter was so thick the mixer was smoking!  We saved this fiasco, finally, by adding 3 eggs, 1/3 c. oil and 1/4 cup water to the batter--then baked the glop for about an hour in a bundt pan.  The result?  A pretty decent light-chocolate pound cake (which, I might add in NO WAY resembles a Boston Cream Pie)!  We did, however, use the glaze above to frost the cake.  I've recorded my own listing of ingredients & instructions for my daughter's & my newest creation: ""MISTAKE CAKE.""  (Look for it in 'Zaar?) 
     All's well that ends well, however, and I'll get back w/ a proper rating after we try this one again -- first having to dissect, clarify & re-write the instructions as I THINK they are meant. Looking at step 1, for instance, directions say: ""Prepare batter for cake layer and bake as directed using (2) 8 round baking pans. Remove one layer from pan and cool.""  Why is there no mention in this entire recipe of the OTHER layer?  Are we to leave that one in the pan it was baked?  Throw it away?  Use as a frisbee?  Although my 15 year old daughter is not a seasoned cook, is it too much to ask for crystal-clear directions for ALL of us?",2002-09-02T19:12:48Z,2002-09-02T19:12:48Z

I cooked it 6 hours on low, saw how thin it was becoming and finished the last hour on high.  Perhaps I misunderstood the directions.  I went ahead and made the cheesesauce on the stovetop, adding the finished sauce to the raw potatoes and ham.  Maybe that's backwards.  Start with a thin, cold, uncooked cheesesauce and 6 hours later, it has thickened?  If I tried it again, that's what I'd do.  ",2004-01-06T19:42:23Z,2004-01-06T19:42:23Z

I also adjusted the ratio of water to wine so that there was more wine than water added.  The flavour and texture of the sauce is exactly right and it only gets better when it's frozen and reheated.  I fed it to a set of finnicky teenagers and they gave it two thumbs up.  The freshly grated Parmesan cheese was the icing on the cake (so to speak).

I think next time I would bake them so the excess marinade would render down nicely rather than go to waste.

My jars were ounces by weight, not fluid ounces, and I was not sure what the recipe meant, so I assumed ounces by weight.  Maybe that is the reason that my sauce was not like a dry paste rub but a thinner sauce.  The only thing I left out was the Old Bay because I did not have it.  Also, I used 5 lbs. of spare ribs and I am not sure if these are the same kind the recipe calls for.  I cooked them at 325 for 2 hours and then put them under the broiler for 10 minutes.

I made this dough for my daughter's ""cooking"" birthday party and I found it excellent to work with and easy to roll out after about 30 minutes of rising time. I rolled the dough out very flat and made 12 (+2 extra) small pizza crusts. (I wanted them to be thin to cut down on baking time when the guests were waiting for lunch!)I prebaked the shells ahead of time and then everyone added their own toppings. I found four shells fit on a cookie sheet and all the pizzas were ready to eat in about 15 minutes. When I was prebaking the shells, I did one as a test one, I forgot to poke a fork around the dough to prevent it from rising and as a surprise it actually formed a hollow pita bread!! I think I'd like to make this again and try to make that on purpose!! However, for pizza crusts, if you prebake them, don't forget to poke with a fork to remove the air!

I also lowered the sodium by making my own spaghetti sauce. Keeps well in the refridgorator for leftovers.  I made two batches just to appease everyone.  I prepared ahead just up to the point of melting the cheese and left it in the fridge until time to cook the pasta I served with it.  Great time saver.

We had it as a side dish tonight, and I plan on eating it for lunch for the rest of the week.

Some recipe notes: 
There are easily 8 side dish servings in this recipe, 6 main dish servings.

I used a 10 inch cast iron skillet, as my onions weren't browning well in the saucepan.  I think using cast iron helped them brown more.

It took about 10 minutes for the tomato paste to color properly.

I used only 1 cup of water and never needed the other cup.

I will be making this again and again...I'm thinking of possibly doing an oven and a crockpot version some day.  I'll keep 'Zaar updated!

24480,28652,26297,20371,Lennie,5,"I needed a crockpot pork chop recipe today to use already-defrosted chops, using ingredients I had on hand, and this recipe came to the rescue! I modified it slightly: I get very bad indigestion from dry onion soup mix, so I omitted it and just sauteed a small onion instead, and added it to the soup mixture, along with a tiny amount of garlic salt. I have also learned to shy away from too much liquid in a crockpot recipe, so I didn't use any water. Turns out the water was not needed; the sauce was perfectly thick. Another thing I have learned about crockpot cooking is not to cook food too long; I cooked this at Low for 5 hours and 45 minutes, and it was just great: the pork chops were tender and falling apart without being dry or pasty. My family enjoyed this easy dinner and I will definitely make it again!",2002-10-21T19:15:31Z,2002-10-21T19:15:31Z

The only change I made was to pan sear the shrimp (after sauteing the mushrooms) instead of boiling them, but as this is a personal preference I wouldn't deduct on points over it.

I made 10 dozen of these cookies for the cookie table at my older son's wedding. It's a custom in northern Ohio to not only have the wedding cake on a separate table but to also have a table, or two, full of cookies made by the bride and grooms family members and friends. I usually tint the icing to reflect the occasion. My sons call these ""Guacamole Cookies"".  That has been the family joke for years. At Christmas time I tint some icing pink and some green. The year I first started making these my older son tasted them and pronounced them his favorite.  As it happens, I had the cookies on a plate with others and had only the green iced ones out.  My younger son asked what they were and, of course, the older one told him they were ""Guacamole Cookies""  No matter what my husbnd and I said, we could not convince the younger one to just try the cookie. Being as stubborn as he, I did not put any more pink ones out that year when he was around.

I'm the cook of my family and I'm the fourth child of 8, so this was fun to make because i love to cook and because everyone loved them.  This was a fun recipie to make.  Here's a tip: make sure the oil is hot but not too hot, or else they might brown very dark real fast.  A way to tell if the oil is hot is to wet your figertips with water and splash the oil.  If it boils immediatly, then the oilis hot, and if it takes more than 3-6 seconds, then you should let it heat a little longer.  Good Luck and Enjoy!

For personal use next time I will reduce the cinnamon by 25%, but other than that, it tastes just like the Butter Streusel you can get in Berlin, Germany at Thobens.

I added a bit more garlic and toasted the mustard seeds a bit, but other than that I didn't change anything.  Thanks, Dee.",2003-07-05T18:43:27Z,2003-07-05T18:43:27Z
34792,39606,50216,47858,rsarahl,3,"This proved to be trickier than I thought and was very interesting since the sauce quantities are open for interpretation.  I used 1 Tbsp chopped jalapeno, 2 Tbsp wasabi paste, 1 Tbsp powdered ginger and about 1/2 cup water.  Since wasabi is japanese horseradish, I didn't add any additional horseradish(the recipe was a little confusing).  Nonetheless, this has quite a zing! 

3 star rating because the sauce recipe is confusing without any quantities; also, the pasta salad was oily using 8 oz of olive oil.  I liked the combination of roasted red pepper, olives and cheese.  There's a lot of potential here: next time I am going to try this using a little sesame oil in the pasta salad instead of olive oil, and I am going to fiddle with the ingredient quantities for the sauce to see if I can get the taste and texture right.

Mimi, do you have any ideas for quantities on the sauce?  I would love to know what you used so I can give this another try.",2003-01-28T12:19:40Z,2003-01-28T12:19:40Z

33691,38461,43623,27783,HeatherFeather,3,"This was a good, hearty casserole. We enjoyed all the different veggies in this and it was also quite easy to prepare and was very economical. My family loves cheesey macaroni casseroles and all of the ingredients appealed to us. Unfortunately, I really didn't enjoy the flavor of the sauce as much as I'd expected. The taste of the Dijon mustard was a bit overpowering - I think next time I would reduce the amount to just a few Tablespoonfuls, rather than the whole 1/2 cup called for. Also, the cook time indicates only 25 minutes, but this is only taking into account the baking of the casserole. Browning the meat, cooking the pasta,and cooking the sauce took an additional 25-30 minutes. UPDATE: The recipe has been edited to correct the amount of mustard since this review was first written.

I also add some butter with the olive oil. If you have a basil plant or use pre-made pesto instead, it's easy to have the ingredients always available for an emergency side dish. Pine nuts and sundried tomatoes keep well in the fridge, etc. I find it easy to cut the basil and sundried tomatoes into small pieces with good kitchen shears. I soak the tomato pieces in hot water at least as long as pasta is boiling. If I think to soak the tomatoes early enough, it's nice to strain the ""tomato water"" into the pasta water to add flavor.

For the sauce, I was able to find both kinds of oil at a local gourmet store that stoks a whole line of TV chef Ming Tsai's products. The only minor change I made was to add a little garlic. Why? well, because my fresh ginger seemed to have some garlic cloves inseparably glued to it. Instead of whisking the ingredients, I threw them all in the food processor - this emulsified the mixture somwhat so that, when one dipped the egg rolls, one got the full benefit of all the wonderful flavours in the sauce. I had never used fresh ginger before - I used ground ginger in the past. Oh, what a delightfully different and more subtle taste the fresh stuff lends to the sauce.

I only used 200mls of tomato juice. As Linda said, its also good with some sour cream to serve. I only use one reaspoon of chili powder which is hot enough for me. I highly recommend this recipe.  UPDATE: This dish is now part of my regular rotation, its also good with chicken mince.

I keep forgetting that you are cooking for more people than I am Mirj, so I'm also going to have to remember to scale down the recipe next time...lol.  It hasn't been very long since I was cooking for an army of hungry teens.  The maple syrup was a really nice touch and not over-poweringly sweet.  I almost reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon because 2 teaspoons seemed like an awfully lot to me since I'm certainly not a salt-aholic like DH (his food looks like it snowed when he gets done and I can be choking on the food without any additional salt because it has so much).  I'm glad I didn't reduce the salt though because it was just right!  Thanks for sharing this recipe Mirj!",2002-10-12T19:47:52Z,2002-10-12T19:47:52Z

It should actually be about 1/4 inch - just barely enough to cover the bottom of the pan.  That keeps the chicken tender.  As the water simmers off, the chicken will carmelize.  That should help with what Jan S noted (watery, didn't caramelize well).

A few quick tips to help - roll out the bread dough on the thin side. It's much easier to handle and roll out this way!  Next time I will make 2 stromboli's.(One out of each loaf of bread dough) We prefered it with a very small amount spaghetti sauce in the stromboli itself.  My kids really enjoyed dipping the stromboli into the heated left over sauce. I baked it on a pizza stone and it browned up beautifully.  If you put a little butter on the top and then sprinkle it with parmesan cheese and italian seasoning before you pop it in the oven, it's even yummier!  Thanks for the great recipe - The kids are still begging us for more.

I have been making, vegetable stock, turkey stock and beef stock for years.  Your recipe is so much better, many thanks for posting.
I made Chicken stock from 2 barbecued chickens and this turned out great.
When I made the soup, I added 1 teaspoon of Chili Powder to give it a bit more bite, great.  Added chicken breast and thighs, precooked, then cut into small chunks and added to soup.
This will be a regular from here on in.
Most enjoyable and satisfying.

It seems to be a match made in heaven for these gel jars because it smells soooo tantalising and romantic. It also looks equally nice. I did add a stick of cinnamon and yes, it looks good in there:) I agree with the other reviewer that this is a real good gift, easy to prepare, looks beautiful, is inexpensive and in my opinion, this smells very nice. I will have to see how this smells over the next few days, but for today, I'd say this is really wonderful. I've already put this to test by placing this as soon as I have made it(while it's still not cooled down to room temperature) in the guest bathroom in my flat(which is smelling horrible coz we had some horrible guests today, lol). Once it cools down to room temp., I'll place it in the fridge and after 2 hours from then, I'll place it back in the bathroom. Lets see what happens. I will post an update tomorrow about how this - I hope and pray it'll work like magic in the bathroom and the bathroom will once again smell fresh and clean;).This would make a simple and nice Valentine's day gift, I think.

My only complaint would be that the cook time needs to be increased.  After 45 minutes a couple of my chicken breasts were still pink.  I put it all back in for another 15 minutes, and while the chicken finished, the rice was still only a little over half done (we ate it anyway).  In the end I'd say cook the whole thing for an hour at the least and maybe put the rice mixture in for about 15 minutes before adding the chicken to ensure that it all gets done.

I used half bread flour and half all-purpose flour, added 1/4 cup of potato flakes and 2 Tbsp. dried milk. I find these additions make for a moister bread that doesn't dry out as fast. I used the entire 6 1/2 cups flour and made the dough in my bread machine. It mixed fine with the larger than recommended amount of flour for the machine, however it did overflow the tub when it was at the end of the rising cycle. Next time I will transfer the dough to a large bowl for rising. The dough was very easy to handle and rolled out nicely. The only problem I encountered was that at the end of the baking time my rolls were not browned at all so I cranked the temp. up to 375° and baked them a few minutes longer. I'm suprised that no one else mentioned having that problem. It seems to me that 325° is a very low temperature to bake bread and therefore I wasn't surprised that they didn't brown properly.

I like that they're pretty nutritious and the flavor is good, although I think they might benefit from some pepper sprinkled on top with the salt and/or a touch of some other spice in the dough.  My only qualm is that even after a couple days of sitting in a paper bag, they're not very crisp or crackerlike- they're a little more of a biscuit-like texture or like a piecrust.  Tender and flakey... which is *good*, just not what I'm looking for in a cracker.  I rolled them in slightly varying thicknesses just to see which thickness would be best- but they're all about the same.  Very buttery tasting and tender and flakey.  I do like the recipe, but perhaps it could use a little more flour for crispness or something?  Thanks for posting.

When I added the milk the dough was the consistency of pancake batter.  I added another cup of flour to save them.  When done, the biscuits did not rise as expected (probably from adding the extra flour and overmixing to compensate).  They tasted like flour.  I'm sorry, I don't know how these rated so high with the current measurements.  I may try in the future to adjust the milk and make them again.",2003-09-07T09:48:50Z,2003-09-07T09:48:50Z

Rather than hand julienning all the vegetables, I chopped the carrots and scallions in the food processor until they were finely chopped, added the whole bean sprouts and hand chopped mushrooms. The bamboo shoots I bought were already julienned. This was a time saver and I don't believe it compromised the results in the least. There was still alot of texture and crunch. I had a hard time following the instructions for folding, so I merely folded the cut wrapper in half and then folded in the ends. They looked perfect after frying. I prepared them completely the day before my party and then heated them on a cookie sheet at 300 for about 10 minutes to crisp them up and heat them. Served with plum sauce. They were delicious and were by the far the favorite appetizer of the evening. Thanks Sue.

I made it as per the recipe, it was easy and economical to prepare and the end result is quite a large casserole.  However I found the dish quite bland, I added some chopped spring onions and grated cheddar cheese to my plate which helped and if I was to make this dish again I would definately add a sauted onion, perhaps some capsicum (and broccoli as suggested)and maybe some hot sauce or other seasonings.  I also wasn't crazy about the texture, which I found a bit gluggy.  It was quite edible, and I imagine that if you have picky kids who don't like anything spicy - with a bit of cheese added before serving they would probably enjoy it.
Thanks for taking the time to submit though Monie, and hopefully I'll have better luck with your Spanish Casserole which looks delicious.",2003-06-29T19:59:21Z,2003-06-29T19:59:21Z

I found 1 tsp.(heaped) to be really less- the drink didn't taste good to me with just 1 tsp. of the mix, so, I went on adding a tsp., and kept checking for the taste. When I had added in the 5th tsp. and took a sip, mmmmmmmmm! HEAVEN! The smell of this beverage filled up the entire kitchen! It is really good! Another suggestion I have is to pour the beverage, once ready to drink, over a sieve, into another cup in order to remove the outer covers of the green cardamoms that were ground in the mixer(mixie)/grinder/blender before being added to this beverage.

A bit of info: this dish in Thailand (kaeng phed kai kap normai on)is often left as a ""food gift"" to the Buddhist monks during late summer (the time of Buddhist Lent). At that time the monks focus not on earthly things, but rather on meditation and teaching.  Supporting the monks with food  during this time is known as ""making merit.""  This dish is a favorite offering as bamboo is in season and the orange of the curry is similiar in color to the monks robes. End of lesson. ;)

I omitted the salt(the stock was salty enough) and added only 1/4 tsp of pepper and would reduce the pepper further next time.

I did use a glass pan and it was okay, just along the bottom it acted like it wasn't quite done, but I did give it extra time. Even with that, I have to rate it 5 stars. It really was good and so was the icing. I didn't have banana flavoring so added a little less than 1/2 tsp. of essence of orange. It was great.

I ended up having to flour each piece just so that I would have edible pieces.
However once this problem was sorted out, the taste was pretty good and the soaking certainly had gotten rid of the excess salt from the brine.

I added more seafood sauce (spicy) and it still didn't do it. When we ate it, we sprinkled Old Bay seasoning on it. We would have been happier to just dip plain cooked shrimp in cocktail sauce.

Instead of the adding the fat, I added 2 Tablespoon of strong brewed coffee like the other recipe I tried called for plus my children love the flavor of coffee.  I liked the idea of using toothpicks to help hold the strawberries while you dipped them in the chocolate. I used a double boiler to melt the chocolate and then added the brewed coffee. I couldnit put the chocolate covered strawberries into the styrofoam without touching the tips. Instead, I placed them on wax paper to dry. ",2003-04-08T15:59:56Z,2003-04-08T15:59:56Z

I wasn't sure if I was supposed to remove the scallops from the marinade before pouring the melted butter on them and baking or if I was supposed to pour the melted butter on them in the marinade pan and then bake them in that same pan.  I left the scallops in the pan and poured the butter on them and then baked.  The bacon on the understand of the scallops (in the marinade) never really cooked.  I guess I should have turned the scallops during cooking to get all sides of the bacon cooked.

It tasted VERY similar to the cake frosting we had on my son's bday cake a few months ago.  I can't believe I made this!  It's the best tasting frosting I made at home.  The other's I've made have been to sweet and gloppy.  My only complaint is mixing in the sugar at the end.  It was a very difficult task to get the grainyness out!  I had to mix for a VERY long time and things got quite messy in the kitchen...just ask my hubby!!!  I almost thought that you meant to say: powered sugar instead of granulated sugar.  But after a good tiresome mixing....the frosting came out perfecto'! Thanks!",2003-09-02T17:58:57Z,2003-09-02T17:58:57Z

64628,71060,17694,86512,AuntWoofieWoof,5,This was soooo good. I haven't had a turnip in a long time. I used one turnip and one Yukon Gold potato.  I cooked them whole with the skins on. After they cooled enought to handle I peeled them and mashed them with my electric mixer. I put in 1/2 cup half-n-half  and the butter to make them really creamy. I had plenty of it!! I will definitely be making these again and again. Better then just plain 'ol mashed taters. Thanks for a great recipe Derf,2003-10-12T20:25:14Z,2003-10-12T20:25:14Z

I took it off just before I added the the egg yolk.

My only regret is that I tried to have the couscous made in advance and just reheat and fluff at serving time (the rest held up just fine this way).  I think I could have pulled it off if I had some vegetable broth, but I thought the couscous suffered a bit and was dry.

In fact, he said it's the best recipe ever from Zaar. (I then reminded him that we had tried your Rum Runner recipe last year and now I think he wants to marry you!)
I made double the sauce. He asked that next time I triple it to have extra sauce for the rice. The sauce is amazing. I accidently tripled the garlic (teaspoon, tablespoon - who's counting) and it was still out of this world.

I hope you get many pleasant reviews for this one. This one's got such a pretty pink colour, an addictive taste, and most of all, I like it because it's low in saturated fat and uses fresh fruit.

When you have bananas that are getting a bit too ripe for just eating, peal them and then freeze -- I wrap them individually in wax paper, then put them in a plastic bag. Cut the frozen banana into chunks before blending.

PS: I like this shake better without the chocolate; I use non-fat dry milk to boost the protein, and I use 2 Tbs. of high quality chunky peanut butter (and a large banana).",2003-08-16T10:45:51Z,2003-08-16T10:45:51Z

I bluntly chopped these filling ingredients and when I sliced the filled dough and then slit the claws a lot of the filling toppled out.  I have since tried this recipe again having pulsed the nuts and raisins in the food processor into a coarsely ground paste (it only took a couple of pulses).  The paste spread easily and adhered to the dough when sliced, yielding a batch of bear claws with all of the filling inside instead of some on the baking sheet.  The taste is exactly the same(yummy), of course, just more filling in each claw!  This pastry is a great breakfast treat, but is equally nice with a cup of afternoon tea.

14988,18458,32011,34173,Myrna in London,5,"This combination of ingredients is both a surprise and a delight.
It was a wonderful combination of sweet and tangy/tart harmonized by a drizzling of olive oil.
When I first read the recipe I was immediately struck by the fact that there were potentially three orange coloured components. (carrots, mandrin oranges and cheddar cheese) I was not altogether sure that I wanted to go that route. As well as that there was a potential for a sameness in textures with the grated carrot, apple and possibly the cheese.
For that reason I choose an extra old white cheddar cheese and cubed it. This gave us both a texture variation as well as a tangyness, and the grated apple (Granny Smith) coupled with the lemon juice the tartness. These two kept the dates and mandarins from appearing overwhelmingly sweet. I nested the works in a bowl lined with the greenest loose-leaf lettuce I could find

I did make a few alterations, however.  I almost always do.

1.  I seasoned the meat as it cooked.  If this isn't done, the meat just tastes like...meat.
2.  I'm certain a 15 ounce jar of picante and a 14 ounce can of refried beans do not exist.  I had to use a 16 ounce jar and a 16 ounce can.
3.  I used a Mexican blend of four cheeses, fancy shred, because I'm lazy.
4.  I added a drained 2.25 ounce of sliced black olives to a layer.
5.  I used two different 14 ounce cans of diced tomatoes.  One was diced with garlic and the other with jalapeños.

       something sticky in coconut. The butter is used cold not melted and the combination with the other ingredients should be like working with modeling clay. Anyway both brands are
       generically what would be called rolled oats. PS

The sliced tomato was the perfect offset to the allspice-cinnamon flavors and the butter-egg wash kept the top of the pitas soft, while the bottoms browned. You will need to melt and cool the butter before adding the egg because softened butter doesnt't work.

From the olive oil? From the sausage? Prob'ly both....but much as I love fat and could scoop up every drop of it, it was a bit much. I just drained the whole thing with a slotted spoon and enjoyed!

65209,71661,73503,6357,Charishma_Ramchanda,5,"These were delish! I liked them without dipping them in chocolate. With chocolate sauce, they become sinful little treats;-) These measurements made 17 PB balls for me. I liked the idea you've mentioned of freezing them for atleast a day to set before dipping them in melted chocolate. Since I've done that before, I know it works. You could also use Hershey's chocolate syrup to dip them in if you do not want to melt chocolate(to save time, fuel and added effort). Otherwise, you can also make chocolate sauce at home like I did and use it for dipping.(I always use recipe number 26276)! This sinful delightful treat is a nice addition to have for the Christmas cookie tray. Since this is eggless, this went even better in my house since one of our very special family friend's who dropped in today, is a pure vegetarian. This was a grand finale to his lunch with us.

This is a perfect side-dish to add colour to your meal. I would suggest snipping the fresh basil right into the pan.

I first tried this last summer and was not impressed.  I think part of the problem was I did not understand the purpose of injera at the Ethiopian table. No one in the family would try it, even with honey&#8230;This week I have been looking at Ethiopian cooking again, and made Dancer&#8217;s &#8220;Ethiopian cheese dip,&#8221; [#38826] which calls for injera bread.  Oddly enough I still had some buckwheat flour left over from my last try at this. Right off, I needed a lot more soda, in fact I ended up putting a cup and a half in (12oz.) Without the extra soda, I was working with globs, more reminisnt of mud pies [when we were kids] than crepes. All in all, I don&#8217;t understand the &#8220;you got to try it:&#8221; it is kind of bland. HOWEVER, when I learn to make an Ethiopian chicken or stew with a little bang in it, I shall make these again as perhaps a bland vehicle to the spicy main course is what is called for.

I order it for lunch at least twice a week when I'm at work (the girl at the counter always laughs at me and asks if I want ""my usual"".)  The best thing about this recipe is it has all the things I miss about fried rice I used to get in Minnesota.  I have yet to find a recipe that adds anything more than peas, carrots and onions to it's fried rice here in Columbia Missouri.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!",2003-04-08T15:44:45Z,2003-04-08T15:44:45Z
48971,54469,26257,72254,L. Duch,4,"Okay, with all the reviews, I just had to try it. Great flavor.
At the end of my cooking, I drained the grease and saved the drippings, then pulled open the butt in several spots, drizzled the drippings over it and covered it and cooked for another 30-45 minuites. Made it very succulant and flavorful. Your sauce was great. The next time I make this I am going to smoke it.

74493,81412,4465,37305,Karen..,2,"I'm sorry for the low rating, but this recipe appears to be off.  I have been making cookies for a long time and have never had a problem with any cookie recipe.  First, I kneaded the dough as instructed...after about 7-8 minutes, I had a lovely dough that was satiny smooth and elastic.  However, I didn't want to cheat on kneading time as stated, so I continued kneading.  Well, the lovely dough turned into as ugly blob.  There was literally melted butter oozing out of it and the dough was starting to seperate (note: the butter was ice cold when I started).  After about 18 minutes, I decided I better stop kneading or it would be completely ruined.  My mother, whose own mother made Kifles (but never left the recipe when she passed), told me that the kneading would make the dough tough, but I told her the recipe said not to cheat!  I went ahead and followed the rest of the recipe.  Second problem: I made the balls only about 1 inch (no larger than a walnut as stated) and got 50, not 85 as listed.  Third problem: Made all of that filling and didn't even need half of it!  I did use the full tablespoon of filling as stated and it was oozing out all over the place.  I am sure this is because the dough was not flaky from so much kneading and could not expand the way it was supposed to...however, I did continue to use the full amount of filling because it was tasty and I felt it would save the cookies.  I am very disapointed because these were expensive and time comsuming to make, but all in all, these cookies have tremendous potential.  I will try these again but I will do the following: 1) Knead the dough for no more than 7-8 minutes AND 2) Prepare only half of the filling recipe.  End result: the dough was VERY tough and not flaky at all but the FILLING was delicious and my mom said it tasted just like her mother's.  P.S.  In the description for these cookies it says ""The trick to making beautiful, tender kieflies is to handle the dough as little, and as gently, as possible.""  Then in the instructions it says ""Knead at least 20 minutes. The longer you work the dough the flakier the finished product will be. Do not cheat on kneading time.""  I guess this contradiction should have tipped me off, but I so wanted to duplicate a recipe my grandmother used to make. ;)  Again, sorry for the low rating, but I had to be honest.",2003-12-29T12:31:58Z,2003-12-29T12:31:58Z

The acidity of the tomatoes was a nice touch, and the proportion of meat to vegetables was right on the mark.  The overall taste of this dish was very well rounded.

The meat was tender, as promised. I marinated it for 18 hours - from 12 midnite till 6pm the next day. I used fresh ginger, sliced thinly as opposed to powder. Didn't have any seasoning salt, so I just omitted that. I thought the dish would be very salty, given the large amount of soy sauce, but it wasn't! My bf hates carrot, so I can't include that (I hate picky eaters!!) or he wouldn't have touch this! I halved the recipe and it was perfect for the both of us.

The flavor, the moistness, everything lived up to expectations, but the recipe was very difficult to follow.  There are problems I had with the cake recipe on my review there, but also the frosting seemed too sugary for my sweet tooth.  I think the problem was that it moved past the thick stage into a watery stage again.  I mean I think I let it boil just a little too long, but without another test for doneness it was hard to tell.

Your recipe seemed to work well, except for the amount of flour. It takes about 15 to 16 cups of all-purpose flour to make a bread dough that can be shaped.
Also, it took about an hour for the bread to bake in a 350 degree oven lined with baking stones. The yield was 6 loaves.

78287,85388,29833,20371,Lennie,4,"This recipe has so many helpful reviews that it needs another review like I need bigger hips! But, I always review what I make, so here's my two cents on this yummy recipe: Very good! I took the suggestions of others and used two cans of soup (we are a family that does like lots of sauce), along with the appropriate amount of water (2/3 cup), plus I added a drained can of mushrooms too. This was a snap to prepare. My only quibble is that, personally, the sauce was just way too salty for me. Is it just me, or are canned soups a lot saltier than they used to be? I am going to hunt down some low-sodium soups (although low-sodium golden mushroom is likely impossible to find) and give this another try. The saltiness didn't seem to bother my hubby, though--he loved this and spooned heaps of sauce on his mashed potatoes!",2004-01-23T09:03:25Z,2004-01-23T09:03:25Z

I rolled the meatballs into larger than bitesized pieces since they reduce in size and baked them in the oven on my Pampered chef stone.  It's less messy that way and they don't need turning like frying in a pan.  I used a slotted flipper to remove the meatballs once they were cooked and wrapped in paper towel to absorb the grease.

This is an excellent recipe! It's far from bland, it's like eating the topping off from a crisp. And I think those are good. My dad isn't big on oatmeal either and he enjoyed this as well. 

I would watch it when it cooks. The edges went a little dark (but still tasty) and it was done 35 minutes along so it was a little drier than I expected.

22744,26694,39490,6357,Charishma_Ramchanda,5,"Wonderful rice dish! I made it for lunch this afternoon. A small difference in my cooking procedure: I started by heating the oil in the skillet. The next step was to add the bayleaf and stir for 30 seconds. Following this, I added the onions and stir-fried until lightly golden. Then, I tossed in the green bell pepper and stir-fried for a few minutes, until the onions were ligtly browned and the bell pepper was nearly cooked. After this, I added in the rice(washed and drained) and cooked it(I mixed it twice in between) for a few minutes(3-4 minutes) on low flame. Next, I added in the dried oregano and mixed it well. Then, I poured in the broth(I prepared it in a separate dish by dissolving 2 cubes of Maggi Vegetable Broth with onion in 3 1/4 cups of water- brought it to a boil until the cubes were dissolved completely). I brought the rice-broth mixture to a boil. Then, lowered the flame and cooked on medium flame, partially covered, until the broth had been absorbed by the rice. Next, I added in the freshly squeezed juice of 1 lemon to give it a beautiful lemony flavour. Mixed it in well and lastly, I garnished it with freshly chopped corriander leaves before serving.
My parents and brother absolutely loved it.

I made the recipe as directed except for doubling the veggies which I was going to use the next day. The flavor combination, color and texture was so great that I used the double batch to top 4 tostados. The bonus flavor of the cheese with the toasted corn flavor and crunch of the tostados was so delightful, I added no toppings and DH  used only chopped fresh tomatoes. We devoured all 4 servings. I will make this again with the double veggies, more cheese and without the toppings. This is a recipe for my book of treasures. ",2003-07-16T20:51:14Z,2003-07-16T20:51:14Z

I used 1 tbsp. of low-fat yogurt as a substitute for cream. Also, I toned down the spiciness by using just 2 red chillies instead of 4. I used about 1 1/2 tsps. of salt. I love dried kasoori methi and I used 2 tsps. of the same(crumbled it between my palms before adding it to bring out its full flavour). Also, I think that when we add freshly powdered spices(masalas), the dish at the end tastes much better. Keeping that in mind, I used freshly powdered cumin and corriander seeds. I did add 1/4 cup water as well in step 6. Also, in step 6, I microwaved on HIGH for 6 minutes. I served these hot with rotis and yogurt, and oh, how they ate! This will also make a good filling for dosa. Just make it as above and incorporating the changes I made and then mash the mixture and stuff inside a dosa(crepe).( This will make a unique and tasty masala dosa!).

Next time I will saute the celery and onions first then add the shrimp.
I did use a hand blender so it would be more creamy(a Bisque) as before blending it was a bit to crisp or should I say chunky.

56104,62132,14812,30716,dale7793,3,Pretty good and comforting type dish. My only problem is that I tested it after 31/2 hours and the middle was nice and creamy with cooked pasta but around the edges was cooked and getting quite dried out so I went against the directions and stirred it and turned the crockpot down to warm for the next two hours. Without this I think it would have become quite hard and dry. But perhaps my crockpot is a little different to some of the others. I used reduced fat milk and evaporated milk also. I added some mustard and chicken stock powder. Without these I think the flavour might have been a bit bland. I served this with grilled chicken and roasted tomatoes and it made a lovely dinner. ,2003-08-03T01:40:04Z,2003-08-03T01:40:04Z

I baked for 30 minutes.Besides the oiled pan I used corn meal to help it from sticking.Which was a good thing because I found it to stick to the sides where there was no corn meal.I also added thinly sliced onions. 5 Roasted garlic cloves was stirred with the rosemary and anchovy.

This is my first experience with a sponge cake as well (I think maybe even my first experience eating one as well as making one) and with the exception of a complete disaster with my frosting attempt (ended up glazing it with a loganberry glaze) it was a very good one.  The cake is light and spongey, very delecate.  I, like WaterMelon, baked it in an 8""x8"" pan with no problem at all.  It's a lovely little golden cake and its amazing how rich it tastes considering its only got a couple eggs, lowfat (I used 2% rather than skim) milk and a tsp of butter!  It was also very easy (I like anything that doesn't require me to cream or melt a ton of butter) and I will definitely be making this again.  I also imagine that the butter melting/milk heating process could be done in the microwave (which I may do next time).

The only change I made was to quickly sear the roast all over in a really hot fry pan before I put it in the crockpot.  However even as a garlic lover I think the garlic taste was a little strong.  I think it is the rub on the outside that really makes it special and next time I will add an extra clove or two of garlic to the rub and omit putting the garlic quaters and bacon slices into the roast.  This recipe would also be great with a lamb roast.",2003-06-29T19:41:53Z,2003-06-29T19:41:53Z
75576,82547,854,4470,Bergy,4," This is a fantastic chicken recipe and would have rated 5 or better stars  but I had to make a couple of adjustments to the recipe. I found that 1 tbsp of sake was simply not enough to massage300 grams of chicken thigh and used 5 tbsp.  I put the chicken into a ziplock bag poured in the sake and massaged it into the  chicken through the bag. let it rest for 30 minutes and found there was none left to drain off. I mixed the dry spices (used  1  1/2 tsp paprika - amt not  given in the recipe) in another zip lock bag added the chicken and tossed until all the pieces were evenly coated. Instead of deep frying I pan fried the chicken in 3 tbsp oil - fantastic, crunchy on the outside and moist inside.  The flavor is very mildly curry but unless you knew it was in there you would be guessing. It is a lovely combination of flavors and will not bite you.  This recipe is one that I can't wait to make again Thanks Recipezaar or whom ever the original chef was that posted this recipe",2004-01-05T08:17:02Z,2004-01-05T08:17:02Z

I had a 4.69 pound pork roast (2 of them made a total of 4.69), and it took a LONG time to cook-- I cooked it at 350 for an hour, and after that I turned it to 400 until it was done (for a total, it took 3.5 hours!) Despite the longer than expected cooking time, it turned out tender and juicy. I originally made the sauce and brushed it all on, and about an hour before it was done I mixed up another batch of sauce and brushed it all on. I used regular white vinegar, and since we didn't have any honey I substituted it with equal amounts of maple syrup (I read that it is an appropriate substitute). Anyways, it turned out delicious!

I didn't think it came out too sweet or anything but after adding cornstarch to thicken gravy, I did add a substantial amount of salt to add more flavor.
A little advice: don't mention there is soda in the gravy until after they eat it. Kids said ""ewwwe"" and had to be pursuaded to try it. Afterwards I could say ""I told you it was tasty"". Thanks for sharing.",2004-06-07T06:50:35Z,2004-06-07T06:50:35Z

I substituted 2 small ancho chili peppers(DH's tummy doesn't like jalapenos). I saw no advantage in using basmati rice in place of Minute Rice.
The result was disappointing. The bell peppers, in spite of the parboiling, were less than tender and the chili peppers over-powered the other stuffing ingredients.  
My regrets to the Chef, but I would not make this again without making some substantial changes - but that's only one opinion.

It's excellent for toasting (we like it spread with cream cheese) and if I like PB&Js I'm sure it would be excellent for that too.  I just made this tonight (already gone through half of one loaf, though).  I was expecting the oatmeal to give it a bit of texture (I think that I am used to making oatmeal cookies) but really all it did was add moisture.  I let this do a long rise overnight in the fridge, took it out, let it finish rising and baked.  Very hearty and homey loaf.  It is not a particularly impressive flavor- just very much dense, moist, hearty comfort food.  All-in-all good. Excellent, easy-to-follow directions.",2003-11-26T01:38:32Z,2003-11-26T01:38:32Z

Also left out the 1/4 cup sugar (diabetic), it was wonderfull anyway, there is a lot of natural sweetness in the fruit juices and it was surprizingly sweet and nice thickened.

I made it into the little pans like you get a store bought pot-pie in and it made five bottoms and three tops, so it would have made four complete pot-pie crusts but I did roll it between plastic wrap to get it thin.

Because I wanted to beat the yolks separately as well, I added all four yolks from the four eggs, so that my little hand blender wouldn't spit egg yolk all over me, and then added just half of the beaten yolks (total 2) to the foamy white.

As stated-
1 (2.00    ounces) package instant pistachio pudding mix 
3   cups milk 
What I used-
2 boxes of 3.4 ounces of instant pudding mix
3 cups milk
I used the 2 boxes becuase I poured the 3 cups of milk and found that no way it would be thick enough.so I added another box of pudding. The crust is just fabulous as well as the cheese filling. Then topped with the pisachio pudding just yum! I skipped the remaing whipped topping.It really doesn`t need it!

The thick mixture of sugars and coconut will harden on its own to make the cookies.  What I do is scoop out balls of the mixture a little smaller than golf balls, put on waxed paper, put another sheet of waxed paper on top, then flatten with the bottom of a glass.  It says to make a hole in the center, which I did with a wooden spoon handle.  You have to work fast before the mixture hardens, so five at a time is about right.  After they harden, melt the chocolate chips in a ziplock bag and cut a small portion off one corner to make drizzling easier.  The originals also have a thin layer of chocolate on the bottom. Granted, they are time consuming and not easy to make (and expensive), but the people that tasted them liked them better than the originals.  Not something I would do on a regular basis, but if you're craving Samoas, these are worth doing.

I rate them 5 stars for taste, but I'd give them a 2 for the trouble factor.  LOL",2004-03-19T09:30:43Z,2004-03-19T09:30:43Z

Most of our family lives in New England and this sounded very much like the stuffing/dressing seasoning we love. I thought it would be wonderful for Xmas gifts and gave it a trial run. I made the seasoning and the stuffing recipe as directed. I mounded the stuffing in a greased baking pan,  topped it with 2 bone-in half chicken breasts and baked the dish at 350°F for 50 minutes. The 2 of us devoured every single crumb of the dressing. The ginger added such a magical flavor that I cut up the leftover chicken and added it to another batch of dressing baked in a  covered casserole dish.

I really am impressed, because who would have thought a low fat cookie would taste so delicious. I love the depth that the oats and whole wheat give this cookie...it really is quite good.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I had to substitute brown sugar for the turbinado in the rub.  It took 12 hours at 250 to cook the 7 lb pork butt - so our dinner schedule was off.  We raised the temperature at the end to speed it up, but that caused the edges to get just a bit too crispy.  Because it was so late, we just nibbled a taste, and saved it for the next night.  Wow, it was delicious the next day.  Lean and tender, and perfectly flavored.  A combination of peppery/sweet. Loved the sauce.  Served it on nice quality buns with cole slaw on the side.

Chicken stock rounds out the mix, but vegetable broth, margarine and soy milk(if necessary) would be a nice change for a vegetarian option.  I did not like step 7 where I had to add the potatoes, broth and seasonings back to the pan only to be taken right back out to the blender.  Next time, I will deglaze the pan with the broth then add the onion and broth mixture to the blender with the potatoes and spices. Seems like it saves some mess in the pan that way.  Also, I did not have to add any milk to my mixture to get a nice puree as the broth was plenty.  But, a nice puree that my toddler especially enjoyed.

I also used egg noodles for the pasta.  It also didn't say whether or not to cover it while it baked so I did because it seemed it would be much to dry if I didn't.  I added garlic and black pepper, also.  I cooked it in an iron skillet as directed, which very much adds to the flavor.
This is so easy and my whole family gave it five stars.  That wouldn't be so impressive if it weren't so unusual for all three of my fellows to agree about food.  My oldest son scolded me for not making a double batch by licking his bowl and making MMMMMMMM noises.    Everyone is already asking me to make it again.  Easy and quickly comes together.

My husband loves when I make homemade pizza, but I was never happy with my crust before -- that is until now!  I followed a couple of the above suggestions, I also used 1 tsp each of the  garlic and onion powders.  And, I put a little BBQ sauce (we had BBQ chicken pizza) on the crust and baked it for a couple minutes before adding the chicken, red onions and cheese.  I also sprinkled just a little cornmeal on my cookie sheet.  I liked it.  It was just a little something different.  The dough was thin, but not paper thin and it wasn't too thick.  My cookie sheets are 13 x 18 (they're like the heavy ones they use on cookie shows) and I only got one pizza.  But I liked the thickness of the crust, so if I wanted more than one pizza in the future I would double the recipe.  One thing, I did have to add a little flour to the dough after it was finished in the machine because it was really sticky.  A little flour folded/kneeded into it and it pressed right into my cookie sheet and was quite tender but still able to hold the toppings really well.

For those who are new to the process, I used 1/4 cup water and a pinch of sugar to dissolve the yeast and somewhere around 2 1/4 - 2 1/2 additional cups of water for the dough.

The recipe was pretty easy to make, and gave me the chance to use some of the more exotic ingredients that I like to keep around, but never use. I used the saffron, but didn't have any rose water.  I think next time I might omit the saffron, too.  I was afraid the rice would stick, but I used my flame tamer and it turned out beautifully.  We really enjoyed it--DH took thirds!  The peas on the side also really added a lot.  Thanks for a good recipe! ",2004-04-30T08:21:42Z,2004-04-30T08:21:42Z

33656,38423,28441,59064,Missy Wombat,5,The only change I made was a minor one - using chicken flavoured vegetable stock as I am a vegetarian. Every Monday I cook a rice dish and I can see this one becoming a favourite especially when zucchini are plentiful. It is a very buttery dish and the taste reflects this. A few extra herbs would not do any harm as it is a quite mild dish. Parmesan or some kind of tasty or sharp cheese is needed to provide a little contrast. I liked the crunchy rice touch and my toddler loved the carrots and the crunchy rice as well. It is a very more-ish dish and it goes down very easily.,2003-01-20T02:05:32Z,2003-01-20T02:05:32Z

I made these the night before, and had to substitute pepperoni and hot italian ham, since I didn't have cooked chicken or salami.  I added shredded parmesan cheese, too.  A word of advice, though; make sure to measure 4 cups of the chopped romaine.  I measured 4 cups, then chopped it, and felt more romaine would've been great.  There are a lot of ways to slightly change this recipe for different tastes - it's very versatile, and would be a great addition to a brunch, casual, or even more formal buffet.  They're perfect finger food, and do look pretty elegant.  My friends, family, & I could not have been more pleased.  We'll be making this often.

I thought 1/2 pound of chicken for 6 servings was not enough--I made it with 1 3/4 pounds.  And it is much easier to eat if you cut the chicken into bite-size servings before cooking.  I cooked it cut into strips, but then pulled them all out and cut them as I couldn't see any advantage to leaving the pieces big.  It was also on the bland side and the sauce to runny.  I stirred in 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it up, but next time I will try stirring about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese into the sauce.  That will give the sauce a bit more dimesion and thicken it up a bit.  A hint I learned about broccoli--if you cook it just until it is done and then drain it and run cold water over it you can preserve the beautiful green color.  I cooked my broccoli separately so I could do this and then tossed it all together and let it warm back up for a minute or two.

I used plain shortening because I didn't have Butter Flavour Crisco, and used smooth homemade peanut butter. I didn't add any extra milk and the consistency was just right! Tip: Move quickly through steps 1 and 2. The shortening tends to ""unmelt"" once it's mixed with the cocoa, and if you don't add in the milk quickly with rapid stirring, you'd get a few stubborn lumps that require some effort getting rid of!

Also, I use both a 9 by 11 inch pan and a smaller pan, like a 7 by 11 inch. That way, it seems a little more evenly spread out. Ok then, I just wanted to let you know what I myself do!

The combination of the masalas was very nice- not spicy and really good. I started off with heating oil in a skillet, then added a chopped onion and the garlic. Stir-fried till the onion was golden-brown and the raw smell of garlic was gone. Then, added in all the vegetables alongwith 5-6 mint(pudina) leaves and cooked for about 5-6 minutes. Then, added in the masalas, mixed well, added rice, a tsp. of basil(dried), 1/4 tsp. of oregano(dried), 1/2 tsp. of rosemary(dried) and 4 cups of Maggi vegetable broth with onions. Brought it to a boil, then reduced heat and partially covered and cooked it till done. I garnished it with 2-3 pudina leaves.

97333,105361,66596,43642,Vino Girl,5,"I brought this to a cook out today, and it was thoroughly enjoyed.  I was asked to share the recipe, too!  I did make a few minor changes just as a matter of personal taste - nothing at all wrong here with the recipe.  I cut the olive oil down to 1/3 cup and the salt to 1 teaspoon.  I put in a full tablespoon of basil, but this was only because I didn't realize I misread the recipe until after I dumped it in.  It turned out fine because we love basil, and so I'll probably continue to make it the same way.  I used grape tomatoes vs. regular in the salad and added a can of artichoke hearts since I had a taste for them (turned out that many others were snatching them out of the salad, so it was a good addition!).  I only used 1/2 an onion since mine seemed really strong.  Finally, after reading some reviews of other recipes, I went with solid feta that I cubed rather than the crumbled type (the cheese didn't disintegrate and become ""lost"" in the salad this way).  The dressing is amazing and so I plan to keep a bottle made up in the fridge regularly!  I have to say that I probably wouldn't have made this if it weren't for the reviews.  The ingredient list seemed rather ordinary to me, but believe me the end result is anything but!  I will make this often.  Thanks for such a great recipe.",2004-05-29T16:18:22Z,2004-05-29T16:18:22Z

Update: I just noticed that the amount of hot sauce in the recipe is different from what we used.  I think it originally had 2 tablespoons?  So tripling 5 tablespoons as the recipe says now might be too much but I bet you could have a total of about 7 or 8 and the sauce would be fine.

I don't know if it needs the full 3 tsp baking soda, is my only thing... mine came out a little thick and I had trouble spreading it, perhaps because of this?  I halved the recipe and cooked it in an 8"" round pan.  I like the suggestion for nuts and I like the butter-drizzling method.  The cake is very fluffy, and the sweet buttery cinnamony topping tastes like something from a bakery. I used ""homemade"" half and half (a mix of half cream and half 2% milk), which worked well.  I added a touch of vanilla extract.  Very good recipe.  I like it better cold or at room temperature, which is nice because you don't have to worry about making this right when you want to eat it to get the best flavor.

The recipe is very easy to follow, quick to prepare and fairly fooproof.  I found that I needed a bit more flour than called for.
I used a saute pan with about 1/2 inch of oil so the prawns had to be turned once.  They cooked in aout 1/2 the time suggested, but that may be a function of higher heat.
The finished product was fine, although a bit bland for my taste.
We served these with a spicy pineapple salsa.
Needless to say I did not have to search further.",2003-07-16T10:41:01Z,2003-07-16T10:41:01Z

92483,100275,25456,47421,KathyRose,4,"This dough was really a pain to work with....just like Jessica said, it was a sticky mess (perhaps from the honey?)  that was extrememly hard to form into loaves.  And as Jessica and Kimberly said, it produced flat bread.  The first rising was fine, but once shaped into the tiny loaves it didn't rise the 2nd time.  I was having such a hard time shaping them into loaves that I only made six loaves instead of eight.  The good part of this recipe is that the bread (flat as it was)  did taste just like Outbacks.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did leave out the instant coffee because I didn't want to spend the $ on a whole jar just to use the two teaspoons.  But it still tasted exactly like Outbacks.  I will make this again because the taste was great.....but next time I will use all the dough to make one regular sized loaf and hopefully can get it to rise better.   Anyone have suggestions on getting it to rise like a normal bread?  Should I try to use more yeast?",2004-04-26T11:26:11Z,2004-04-26T11:26:11Z

Most sauces have sugar in them and are too sweet, but I found this one to be just right.  It was a very easy recipe to do.  I used fresh tomatoes and garlic in a jar (so I couldn't take out the garlic as it said), but the taste was wonderful.  I omitted the spareribs/pork shoulder.  I found using the fresh tomatoes you need to add another can of tomato paste to thicken it up a little as it was a little watery on the plate.  I will make this again and again!!!!  I made this on Sunday and Tuesday evening there was only a little sauce and sausage left.  In my estimation the sauce and meatballs were much better than any Italian Restaurant.  This was my first attempt at making my own sauce from scratch.  I guess I never found one that struck my fancy, but this one hit a spark and I am so grateful that I found Recipezaar.

You can take them from the freezer to the oven  and just heat until defrosted & warm- I recommend a conventional oven rather than a Microwave.

42679,47813,57666,49163,Ann Marie F,5,"There are some choices to make within the recipe. Mexican Velveeta comes in hot and mild. Rotel comes in regular, mild, and two others. I chose the hotter versions of both and I'm glad I did because I like hot stuff. 

I made this twice. The 2nd time I used 2 cans of no-salt black beans instead of one can of pinto beans. I greatly prefer the black beans. Both times I used frozen corn instead of canned to reduce the sodium content. To make up for the liquid in the can of corn I added 1/4 cup of low sodium beef stock. 

I tasted it before adding the Velveeta. It was darn good without it. Next time I may use half the amount of Velveeta or eliminate it and top each serving with grated pepper cheese instead. By the way, cubing Velveeta was interesting. It glued itself back together after the knife went thru it. But it melted like a dream. 

Next time I think I'll use two cans of black beans because I liked them, two cans of stewed tomatoes because I like them, and no Velveeta, adding grated pepper cheese to the top instead.

Or less Velveeta and add  grated pepper cheese on top.

Or.....

Whatever I do, I think I'd like a sprinkling of sliced green onion  on top. And of course, chives, since mine are already up.

It was full of fruit and I gave up on keeping the raspberries whole, I smushed them to get the juice then whisked everything together. Lots of flavor, no Jell-Oey taste and it was creamy.

Since I was using flavored breadcrumbs I didn't use additional spices.  However, I used Locatelli Cheese which is a type of Romano/Parmesan Cheese. Also, I didn't cut the Chicken Breasts.  Baked at 350 for 1 hour.  Excellent taste, flavor, easy to prepare.  I definitely would make this recipe again and I might even try the Ritz Crackers next time. 

Another thought, you could add Provolone Cheese on top of the Chicken when it's almost done add a little Marina Sauce and you have Chicken Parmesan with a side of Angle Hair Pasta, Antipasto Salad, nice Red Wine.  Great Gourmet Dinner!",2002-05-20T19:04:06Z,2002-05-20T19:04:06Z

Take ¼ c Raisins finely chopped and place in saucepan

Add:  1 ½ tsp Nutmeg

          1 ½ tsp cinnamon

          ¼ C Brown Sugar (packed)

	1 tsp Molasses 

            ¼ C butter

	½ Milky way Chocolate bar (broken up)

Heat mixture on low until all is caramelized 

Then spread throughout creamed mixture (mmmmm) 

Add oats then other raisins.

Try It!! It’s really good!!

To make the cabbage preparation a cinch, this is my tip:  Core cabbage, wash, and wrap in a clean dish towel, then microwave for about 5 minutes (this is an estimate).  After the cabbage cools off, leaves can be easily removed.
What a great dish, I purposely fixed enough  for two meals.  Put some red potatoes right on top to bake along, and it worked out great.

This time I wish I had. The margarine/sugar/flour mixture mixes up kind of like sand, and it stays that way. Eating the finished product is like oats and applesauce mixed with sweet sand. At first I was going to suggest cutting down the amount of flour and oats, but then I realized that would be making it into essentially an apple crisp. In fact, rather than bars, it is more like an apple crisp with waaay too much flour. I did use my neighbor's homemade applesauce, which is very chunky, rather than canned applesauce, but I can't imagine that even canned sauce would absorb into the flour/oats mixture to make the texture acceptable on these.

It did separate as it cooked, just like you said.  However, the bottom of it wasn't a creamy pudding, it was very watery and really not edible...I guess it didn't set right or something.  I baked it as directed for 45 minutes, and the top got really brown.  I'm still giving it 4 stars though, because the top of it tasted great...just like a very light lemony spongecake.  Maybe if you could help me figure out what went wrong with the bottom, I'd try it again.  ",2003-01-24T10:23:07Z,2003-01-24T10:23:07Z

I used a 12 inch skillet, and the 1/3 cup of broth wasn't enough to last the 8 minutes for steaming, so my first few got a bit dark, but STILL delicious(like I was going to waste them, lol!).  So for the next batch, I used 2/3 cup of broth, and they were perfect!  The filling is spectacular and very easy to put together.  I used the cole slaw mix from the produce dept to save time on shredding cabbage, and left out any pieces that may have been too big--this worked perfectly.  You can bet I'll be making these again and again.  I can see why you get requests for them!  Thanks Kelly! :)",2004-01-12T05:46:40Z,2004-01-12T05:46:40Z

Maybe I didn't mix the pudding up enough in the water and juice from the pineapple but it wasn't as firm as I like. I think if making it again I will just use 1/4 cup water or no water.

I immediately  harkened upon almonds,  and this recipe.  It worked perfectly.  I used a pyrex dish, but, as instructed by the recipe, used tin foil.  I don't think this was necessary, had I merely buttered the dish, and gone on with it.   When I pulled the pan at about 35 minutes, the top was quite browned:  I thought it done.  In fact, the interior was still far too liquidy.  I pulled the bars out with the tin foil, so they would cool a bit faster, and everything split apart. A closer inspection revealed that the interior of the product was still pure liquid, a bit too underdone for even my tastes.  I placed them back in the oven for about 20 minutes before they finished cooking, perhaps a slight underdoneness revealed with a prick of a skewer.  When these were placed back in the oven, I covered them with tinfoil to prevent further browning.  The rest of the recipe was continued as instructed, and left to cool.  These were thoroughly enjoyed by all- full of complexity, almonds, and a touch of chocolate to round everything out.  I didn't have to come back the following day for an empty pan, it returned with me tonight.   This is a fantastic, if only slightly expens-y dessert.  But worth it.  Share it with those you love.

I added a little fresh cream (which I had to use as it was lying in my fridge for sometime) to the filling and it cooked it for 20 minutes (not yet firm). I took it out sprinkled the powdered sugar and put it back into the hot oven and let it caramalise a bit for 5 minutes (I cooked at 175C and now covered the rim with foil so that the crust did not burn) It took me 30 mins in all for the filling to firm though I think the cream was the cause. But it worked out fine as the sugar was nicely caramalised. It was yummy. The taste of lemon was so gooooooooood. I took it out of the oven and cooled it and in 15 minutes they were gone.

I can't believe how wonderful this tasted.  I made this exactly as directed, and think that the simmering was the key...it just ""melded"" all the flavors of the salsa and green chiles to taste like a much more complex sauce.  The cumin was exactly perfect - it's one of those spices where just a tad too much is WAY too much for me, but it subtly enhanced all the flavors without overpowering in any way.  I made this in a snap, and served it with corn that I sauteed with butter, parsley, and a bit of chipotle powder, to extend the tex-mex theme.  We also had a green salad with tomatoes and avocadoes and a simple vinaigrette.  We enjoyed this meal immensely, and will be making this for friends.

I hope that anyone who wants to try brewing will vist a homebrew supply co. to buy not only sanitizer but a package of brewer's yeast, yeast nutrient, and a couple of airlocks with stoppers to fit gallon jugs.  This should all cost less than 5 dollars if you have your own jugs.  I would also use corn sugar, fructose, or honey in this recipe for best results.  Table sugar will give your brew a cidery flavor.  Sanitized plastic soda bottles and screw caps should work for bottling but be patient.  It takes about 2-3 weeks for the ""fizz"" to develop fully.

I didn't have the wine on hand, so for the gravy I separated the fat from the roasting pan and added the juices to two packets of Schilling Au Jus, prepared per packet instructions in a saucepan on the stove.

68050,74664,56207,86318,mianbao,0,"I was intrigued by this recipe, so when the chance rolled around to make a recipe for a chef whose name began with M, for the Chef Alphabet Soup Game, I jumped at it. I got the eggplants out, and read that I needed coconut oil. That is something that has never been in my kitchen, so I used bland vegetable oil instead. I had the other ingredients, including the galangal. The baked eggplant was tender and very nice. The sauce didn't seem quite right, so I added some coconut milk. This brought the flavor up to OK on the eggplant. The tomato-galangal-lime combination is unusual in my experience. The strange thing is that the flavor seemed to grow on me, and, as the evening went on, I tried the sauce on fried food I was cooking, and it was very nice! So, I'm confused. I don't know the background of this cuisine at all, or what foods this sauce would typically be used with. I also don't know how much difference the lack of coconut oil and the addition of coconut milk would make, so I don't feel qualified to give a rating. But thank you for the experience. I'm glad I finally tried it.",2003-11-09T05:13:26Z,2003-11-09T05:13:26Z

I think adding some tarragon helped, although I also ooverdid that a bit as well.  Oops!  Ahh well, it all turned out okay in the end.  The one extra point I would like to add is that, if you cut the recipe down to one or two servings, you need to use either chicken breasts or to use the 2pts of milk as suggested in the recipe.  The 1/2 pt of milk that I used didn't cover the chicken quarter quite enough & the very middle turned out to be a bit too pink.  But that's my own fault for not checking properly!

I made mine with o half recipe of Mean Chef's Homemade Condensed Milk (#53911) and rather than dirtying my blender, I just put this in a pretty bottle and shook, shook, shook.  It's blended nicely and is quite pretty.  I'm drinking some now in just a cup of hot black tea, and its nice- Mishkapett is right, in this recipe you cannot identify one spice in particular, its just a   nice spicey blend.  I can't wait for it to cool (just made the condensed milk, so its hot) and I'm sure it will be even better after 24 hours of chilling.  One thing, though- when I first made it, I made it exactly as the recipe states, but I felt something was missing... added a little vanilla extract as others have suggested and it was perfect.  That's the only thing wrong with the recipe to me (and I don't think that's worth demoting it to a 4-star review, especially since this is so easy, yummy and as the title says awesome and economical!

93519,101382,8701,91867,The Giggle Box,4,"I made these last week for dinner.  Half the guests wanted ribs, the other half wanted chicken.  
I used Baby Back ribs and I marinated them in a 1/2 recipe of the sauce overnight.  I then let them cook at 325 degrees for 4 hours.  They were wonderful (or so I was told).  
I used leg quarters (thigh/leg combo) for the chicken folk.  I had 4 large quarters, so I used a full sauce recipe.  I cooked the chicken for about 2 1/2 hours.  The sauce on the chicken was very thin, so it did not give the chicken a lot of flavor.  I broiled it until the skin on the chicken got crispy, but that didn't help thicken the sauce too much. 
I tasted the sauce before adding it to the meat, and each time, it was quite good. Maybe I didn't measure an ingredient correctly for the chicken sauce.  I don't know.  Overall, it was very good and very easy to put together.  ",2004-05-03T15:59:47Z,2004-05-03T15:59:47Z

I cut the hen in half and with a heavy knife flattened out the half-bird.  I prepared some chicken stuffing and put a one cup mound under each half of the hen.  I rubbed the halves with butter then roasted it in a flat pan at 375 degrees for 40 minutes.  The stuffing soaked up all the chicken drippings so if you're worried about fat this isn't the receipe for you.  But YUM....  After 40 minutes I basted the halves with the glaze and roasted for another 10 minutes.  Served with some parsley potatoes and white/yellow sweet corn mix.

Second batch was in for six minutes, which apparently long enough -- cookies were chewy instead of crunchy -- but which still caused some burning around the edges.  The difficulty finding the right cooking time may be due to the fact that I bake in a gas oven.

Also, you apparently have to put the cookies FAR APART on the cookie sheets.  I put them with about an inch and a half of space separating them, and they all merged together into a sheet of cookie, so I don't know exactly how far apart will work.

I also placed frozen chicken breasts in at the beginning and pulled it out to shred before serving. Put shredded chicken back in crockpot to warm.

The bread spread out too much and was too soft. I have since tried it twice - each time mixing by hand. The trick seems to be to get the dough firm enough to form nice loaves. I find that I need to add 1 cup or more flour. (The recipe does say to add flour if it's sticky.) Even with the extra flour the bread is light. I think this dough should be firmer than usual white bread dough. I also kneaded it thoroughly. I tried this recipe twice with the wine and once without, and while I think the wine adds a hint of sweetness, the bread is also very good with just water. I quite like the bread with the amounts of basil and sage given, though I think this can be easily adjusted for personal preferences. I made one batch with an Italian seasoning mix, which I thought was nice, too. And I am in the process of making one more batch with only caraway seeds  - boring, I know, but I love them.

I had a little trouble with the coating wanting to separate from the chicken while I was cooking it, but for the most part it worked out OK.

I made it with Mean's China Moon Double Chicken Stock.  And then I also made the Pig Pickin Sauce.  They are very different from each other.  They are both terrific with this.

my saga, keep in mind I'm a novice cook, guy and blond. That'll tell you some thing.
I had no idea what was meant by wetting down the crock pot with water, so i put some on the sides and bottom to eliminate the burn some had indicated might happen.
I made everything according to the receipe instructions, after completing I moved the crock pot and saw (my first uh oh) the cottage cheese in back of the pot. I poured on top, took a knife and (haha) shoved the cottage cheese down the sides of the noodles. Turned the pot on came back and checked and it was cold as ice, then i noticed it wasnt plugged in.
Plugged it in , turned on high for 2 hours, then on low for 1 hour. Results   absolutely great meal. I'm not suggesting you do the same  but for me  it worked great.

They look rather flat rather than having the characteristic dome-tops of muffins and are a little dense, it seems.  I don't know enough about kitchen chemistry, but I am looking at my Baker's Dozen cookbook and it recommends 1tsp baking powder for every cup of flour (unless there are heavy ingredients like chocolate chips, raisins, fruit etc. (and I would consider the raspberries to be in this catagory) wherein it suggests you use 1.5tsp for every cup of flour.)  Also, it reccommends that you use 1/4tsp baking soda per cup of flour or up to 1/2tsp per cup of flour if you have the afore mentioned heavy ingredients.  That was really the only problem, and as I said before I'm sure they taste wonderful- they're just looking a little more like cookies than muffins, almost.  I used almond extract, not hazelnut but I figured that the extract amounts being Tablespoons was a typo because 2TBS total of extracts seems like a WHOLE LOT.

It gives the meat a really nice texture and I think I may do this for all my beef stir fries from now on. The marinade is full of flavour and the whole meal comes together very quickly, once you've chopped the veggies. It would be good for a dinner party because you could do most of the work ahead of time. The servings are generous. We cut the meat in half and also cut back on the veggies, as there are just two of us, and there was still enough for seconds.",2004-04-04T11:32:23Z,2004-04-04T11:32:23Z

I added diced green chilis, diced roasted peppers and pimentos, green and black sliced olives, some frozen baby corn kernals, and lots of shredded cheese and about 14 eggs. I did have to bake them at a lower temp for a longer time [350 for @35-45 minutes].This made 72 regular rice muffins and a dozen mini-muffins.

  This is a great recipe,we tried it the other night,and loved the way the meat stuck together,it wasn't as sloppy as taco's usually are but it had the good Mexicn flavor it should have too.
Thanks we will absolutely use this recipe every time we make taco's

Since I was running low on time, I found that I had a can of chopped tomatoes with onion and garlic in the pantry, and used that to sub for the fresh tomatoes, garlic, and onion. I wish I hadn't! Plus, the Tilapia was a frozen package, so I don't think the quality was the best. Also, I didn't opt for the wine in it. However, this was a great recipe- easy and, I am sure, quite tasty. I can't wait to try this again. Thanks!

71524,78299,44299,68727,beckas,5,"This is an excellent recipe for stuffing.  I made it for Thanksgiving and I was pleased with the results.  I received several compliments from my family members about how good this was.  I used homemade cornbread cubes and toasted french bread cubes as the bread.  I omitted the mushrooms, eggs, and salt and used only 1/2 tsp pepper.  We like our stuffing on the dry side so I also omitted the eggs as well.  I assembled the stuffing the day before and baked it on Thanksgiving day.  I noticed that the spices were more dominant the second day and the stuffing was a tad more moist.  I thought I should mention that just in case anyone makes this stuffing the day ahead like I did.  Thanks crazymom for sharing this recipe.

I've made it with dried beans and leeks and also with canned beans (2 cups) and no leeks, just onions, carrots and celery.  When using canned beans, it only needs to cook for 20 minutes.

I have made this recipe twice, and even consulted Leannr regarding the possible problem, but I can't figure it out.  All I know is that the crust when I made it did not bake in 25 minutes.  Nor did it bake in 45 minutes.  Or at least, it still tasted of raw oatmeal, and when the bars were cut they fell completely apart.  I made it the first time with figs, and the second time with dates.  Neither time did the crust come out the way I wanted it to.  I was very disappointed, because I did want to like these, but I didn't.  The filling, however, is perfect.  Perfect taste, perfect texture.  If I can find a crust that works for me, I will continue to use this filling because it really is wonderful.  I'm sorry, Leannr.  I tried, I really did.",2003-02-26T07:25:42Z,2003-02-26T07:25:42Z

My objections to any recipes I have tried in the past are these…touch, greasy and tasteless.

So when I stumbled across this recipe that was not remotely greasy, very tender and wonderfully flavourful I know that it will become a family staple.

I chose to use milk (one of the liquid options) but think I may try the broth the next time due to the fact that the colour of the loaf was a little pale. Again that may be due  to the way I cooked it.

In Sweden, until abt. 1940, we had no gastronomy whatsoever.

I've made these several times now. Each time, I've substituted ground turkey for the ground beef and added 1/4 cup oats to the mix to compensate for the extra moisture in the turkey. It comes out great this way!

The first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly (aside from the meat switch,) and they were yummy over rice. The second time, I used Cream of Mushroom soup for a different taste, and they were great over wide egg noodles. The third time, tonight, I swapped Italian Seasoning for the parsley, omitted the water, and added a can of chopped tomatoes, with juice, to the soup and Worscestershire sauce, then served them over rice again, although pasta would have been good too.

I've really enjoyed this recipe, and it's now my standard meatball dish. It's infinitely customizable, simple, and the whole family loves it! Next time, I think I'll use Golden Mushroom or Onion soup and serve with mashed potatoes.

I used about a half pound of sweet Italian sausage, which I cooked and then drained on paper towels to remove as much grease as possible. The sauce is nice and thick and works well for Once A Month Cooking because it freezes nicely. I'll make this one again. UPDATE: I won't be buying the bottled sauce any more and I threw out my old spaghetti sauce recipe!   I have several containers of this sauce in my freezer now.  The one change I made was to lower the fat content by using only 1/2 pound of sweet Italian sausage.  I fried the sausage and drained it well before using.  The taste is still great even with much less meat.  I put this recipe in my Once a Month Cooking file.",2002-05-07T16:25:40Z,2002-05-07T16:25:40Z

While I enjoyed the nuts, I think you could easily leave them out. I had trouble getting the cream cheese mixture to swirl properly - mine seized up once it hit the partially chilled gelatin.  I think next time, I would instead mix some of the gelatin mixture with the cream cheese mixture, then spread it evenly on top of the partially set gelatin, then chill until firm, rather than attempting swirling the mixture.

I served with my own Jeff's Yorkshire Pudding.  I have found you just can't improve on any of Miss Annie's recipes.  Always perfect ; ),2004-01-02T04:48:24Z,2004-01-02T04:48:24Z

26009,30376,42957,6357,Charishma_Ramchanda,5,"This is truly elegant and the mixture of the prepared syrup that goes into the oranges, is extremely addictive. Nothing can be more divine to one's taste buds than this dessert on a hot sunny afternoon. I loved the idea of the orange liquer as well as serving it in oranges - looked really cute and elegant. The only thing I omitted was the orange zest as we don't like the zest of anything in our food(just a personal preference).
A definite keeper, it was a huge hit amongst our friends' this afternoon for our Diwali get-together. Thanks so much for sharing this.
Will repeat this tasty, economical, elegant and ""To die for"" recipe often. Last but not the least, I loved the name of this recipe:)

I used 3/4 cup instant Tang orange drink, 2 cups all-purpose flour(instead of self-raising flour), 1/2 cup oil, 1/4 cup yoghurt(as a substitute for sur cream), 2 cups sugar, 2 eggs, 1 cup fresh orange juice, 1 tsp. vanilla essence and 1/4 tsp. pineapple essence. This particular cake took 1 hour 30 minutes to bake in my AMC Dutch Oven. Once done and cooled, I frosted this cake with 3/4 cup of vanilla ice-cream(softened). This cake needs to be served chilled to be enjoyed best. The blend of vanilla and orange go very well together in this cake.

The sandwiches were easy to put together, though the directions seem a little difficult to follow in the exact order as described - or you keep thinking that you are going to get stuff all over your hands.  Basically the butter/cinnamon/sugar are on the outside of the sandwich and the cream cheese and banana are on the inside.  My husband pretty much assembled the sandwich on the frying pan.  We did feel it took a long time to brown on low so we turned the heat up to medium.  But it was very good!!!  And it was not messy gooey.  It was sweet enough.

A real winner, especially considering how easily and quickly they came together! Thank you very much! UPDATE: I've made these yet again. Half a batch the chocolate-orange, and the other half a devil's food with white chocolate chunks & almond bits. Mmm.

I made this pretty much as peppermintkitty wrote it, except that I substituted one can of Rotel Original diced tomatoes and green chiles for the can of diced tomatoes and can of diced green chiles.  Also, I used a bulk taco seasoning that I buy at a store nearby, which worked out well.  For the milk, I used skim.

Anyway, the first 'taker' ate it like a dip, with tortilla chips and liked it but said there was way too much cheese (I used 1 1/2 cups of mild cheddar).  The 2nd 'taker' ate it with heated, flour tortillas and loved it, saying it tasted like tamales.  His son ate it with chips and had 3 helpings, almost wiping it out for number 4, who also had it with flour tortillas and loved it!  I was left with a scant cup; in the end, it fed 6 people.

This is very simple and easy to make and has the right texture and taste.

Your instructions are so clear even a first time user of rice paper would be able to follow (I have usedrice paper often but I remember the first time). The hoisin sauce is flavorful yet not too spicy - I put in the peanuts just before serving so there was an extra crunch in the sauce. The Nuoc Cham Dipping sauce is excellent (I upped the cayenne a notch or two) the lime is just right in balancing the fish sauce and garlic. I made sure that the asparagus was still crunchy and left the head poking out of the wrap resting on the red lettuce. This time I used the larger size rice paper (about 9"") but I also have some 6"" which I would use next time for a smaller appetizer roll.

My husband is a chocaholic and I knew it would be a real test if I make it in the future. When I made it he helped me and for the color of the cake being very light brown we weren't to sure about the flavor.  Don't let the color of the cake interfer with your decision as it was very chocolately and a hit with my husband.  I didn't ice the cake but we tried taking some chocolate syrup used on ice cream and drizzled it over individual slices of cake.  Now that made it even better.

81545,88782,16438,74558,TOOLBELT DIVA,5,"Mirj: This recipe was forwarded to me by Iron Bloomers and a link in the most unlikely of places.  She did this because she felt that I needed to do it right.  Given that this is probably a Kosher recipe I made certain I acquired all 2,044 ants from the custodian at the Beth Shalom Synagogue.  He was very accommodating and I expressed my gratitude by telling him I was a friend of your's.  With that information, he handed me an additional 2,044 ants so that I could double the recipe.  I took the ants home, and followed your instructions for preservation.  However, given my delicate diabetic condition, I could not preserve these tiny creatures in sugar, so I used Equal.  Four lbs. of Equal, kept the ants secure and happy for one week.  At the end of the week.  I melted six cups of dark chocolate (double the recipe), added 1 lb. of sliced almonds for an additional crunch.  As this delicacy was being prepared for a valentine dinner surprise time is not on my side, so I eliminated step 2; removal of ant entrails.  It worked very well; but because these ants were still ambulatory, it was a challenge to keep them in one bowl whilst chocolate was melting.  Never accused of lacking resourcefulness, this challenge was circumvented by putting all of the ants into the chocolate during the melting process.  It worked well, and I am happy to report, not one ant was lost in the foray.
Please advise what I am to do with all of this chocolate now that my dinner guests have cancelled at the last minute.  For your painstaking efforts I give you five thumbs up, and an additional 5 stars for recipe clarity.  Thank you for sharing.",2004-02-14T14:16:40Z,2004-02-14T14:16:40Z

Based on my travels to the various countries including Europe, Asia and US, this version of French Onion soup is one of the best I've had. My husband who is from London just loves this recipe.

It is robust and hearty in beef and onion flavour and quite thick so you can enjoy this as a meal in itself (you might say it's great comfort food).  Be sure to use the broiler until the cheese bubbles and turns golden brown over the French bread. Tip: Try to use the fresh French bread which is a bit chewy in texture.

HOWEVER, I did not like the tortillas as dumplings and that's why I didn't give this 5 stars.  I couldn't get over the ""burrito"" flavor of the flour tortillas (they just have a sort of mexican flavor to them, and yes, they were plain flour tortillas.)  But for those of you who decide to use them, the longer they soak in the broth, the less they taste ""mexican"".  But they also had sort of a sweetness to them that I didn't like.

27976,32446,21761,32724,MEAN CHEF,5,Normally I steam the brussel sprouts then saute in browned garlic butter and sprinkle with parmesan. So I figured this was just another avenue to the same thing. WRONG!!. These are fabulous and far superior to the way I made them before. The cooking time was perfect and the brown roasty part is an excellent touch. Even with exactly the same ingredients this technique produces a much better result. Do not forget to salt and pepper liberally. At the end of cooking I did swirl in another pat of butter.

I also thought that it seemed like too many berries to put it, so I didn't put a full two pints in, but wished I had - they all would have fit just fine.

My boyfriend thought I had someone over because I couldn't quit ooh-ing and aaah-ing! I'd never do it differently... -- posted Apr 2, 2003, 2 members found this helpful""  

Updated 11/27/04 - This is a lot of work and SO worth it!  I cooked the turkey for the first time for my family and my BF's (the latter family is used to dining at very nice holiday buffets).  I brined for 24 hours, and let sit in an empty pot to air dry for another 12 (saves a few paper towel rolls).  I depended on a probe, and when it read 161 at the breast and 175 at the thigh, I removed it from the oven.  My 17 pound bird only roasted for 2 hours to reach these temps.  My mom raved, and my BF's stoic father said mid-feast, ""This is the best turkey I have ever had.""  BF summed it up very well:  ""Moistest white meat in the world, but a little flavorless in comparison to the dark meat, which is has great flavor (from the aromatics).""  Next year, I may rub a salt-garlic-rosemary paste under the breast skin.  PLEASE TRY THIS RECIPE.  You won’t be sorry.

I cook my cheesecakes in a water bath.  Place the cheesecake in the oven in a water bath at 350 degrees and bake for one hour.  Then, leave the cheesecake in the oven in the water bath, turn the oven off and let the cheesecake sit in the oven for one hour.  Take cheesecake out of the oven and run a knife around the edge of the cheesecake to loosen from the springform pan.  Let cheesecake cool for a couple of hours on a wire rack.  Cover the cheesecake and put it in the refrigerator to cool.  Take the cheesecake out of the refrigerator and remove the springform pan before serving.  I made a pineapple sauce and served it on the side.  Puree fresh pineapple then chop a little pineapple up and stir it into the puree.  The sauce is great.

Perhaps it could have been a little on the sweeter side. What really made the dish tasty and made me keep wanting to eat it was the toasted almonds (love cruncy things in my food). I think I might make this again b/c it was a ""light"" dish (perfect for a dieter) and perfect for a hot summer day, but I will definately have to some adjustments to the dressing and use a different pasta (the spiral kind - multi colored for presentation) so that it ""grabs"" the sauce.

To me you MUST at least add mirin or dry sherry at the very least.
Instead of Kikkoman I would suggest Yamasa shoyu and a splash of organic Tamari (just my personal preference).
I would leave out the oil as well.
That isnt to say this doesnt look appealing in some ways, it just simply is not very authentic. With a good portion of sake and mirin added this might be better.
Plus I would suggest making the sauce first and reserving some to heat up as a tare or dipping sauce, before putting raw meat (especially chicken) in to marinate. Also there is no way I would marinate any meat in shoyu base for over an hour. 2 hours is overkill. The shoyu gets too pronounced and salty and toughens meat in my opinion. 
I would suggest 30 minutes to 1 hour total marination time.

The stuffing came out very moist, rich, and was a nice accompaniment to the pork.  I will definitely make this again",2004-02-05T20:34:14Z,2004-02-05T20:34:14Z

Initially I was attracted to the unusual ingredients in this recipe; walnut oil, potato starch, etc. not the usual staples required for muffin making. 

The muffins were exceedingly moist (the walnut oil no doubt) and I particularly loved the addition of cinnamon, a nice, delicate balance with the banana and walnuts. Hubby thought they were a little bit sweet but I thought they were just right, I suppose sugar to taste will vary slightly from one to another. 

These are definitely a keeper in our house. I’m submitting a photo of these tasty morsels and I would encourage anyone to indulge themselves in baking up a batch of these marvelous muffins!",2002-07-14T14:57:00Z,2002-07-14T14:57:00Z

I've included the picture.  This sauce is excellent.  The only thing I did different was change from the greek seasoning to Mrs. Dash Salt Substitute.  The greek seasoning was too salty for ""Pop's"" diet.  I got grape tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, stuffed olives, and salad greens.  Then I boiled up some wonderful shrimp and mixed them with the sauce.  Three cups is a lot, so he has leftover - which he of course doesn't mind at all!  It was food fit for a king, rightfully so.

First, on a brisket that I really tried to screw up -- by starting it in the oven then moving it to the crockpot. It turned out fabulous and tender anyway.
Then, I used the same recipe on a pot roast cut of meat -- but before I put it down on the foil, I cut a couple of sweet onions into wedges and rested the meat on that. That was rip-roaring good, too. We used the shredded leftovers with some Stubbs bbq sauce for sandwiches. Thanks for a great recipe.

It was just right for the kids with ketchup, and I added some Cholula (like Tabasco only better) and ketchup. Good easy dish!",2002-10-12T11:38:41Z,2002-10-12T11:38:41Z

New review:  After CountryLady told me that there's a typo in the recipe and it should be 14 ounces, I knew I was right to quadruple the recipe!  I also quadrupled the garlic, there is nothing as delicious as garlicky, tomatoey greenbeans!  Great recipe using the right proportions!",2003-07-15T06:15:14Z,2003-07-15T06:15:14Z

That, the juice and the olives over-powered the other flavors. I think the lemon pulp needed to removed, and the juice needed to be reduced to a couple of tablespoons. It was also difficult to get the 1/3 cup flour to adhere to the chicken pieces once coated with the spice/cilantro mix. Maybe they could have been mixed with the flour and done in one step.

The coating then became mushy - yikes!  The taste was bland as all get out -- you couldn't really taste the garlic and parmesan.  I used dried parsley flakes rather than fresh, but I can't imagine that made all the difference.  I'll stick with my own oven-fried chicken method, which is dip in egg, coat in seasoned (and salted!) flour, roll in melted margarine and bake.  I always sprinkle with extra seasoned salt done.  Tastes great!  I'll never use this recipe again.  Sorry!",2003-11-17T16:26:19Z,2003-11-17T16:26:19Z

The texture was most pleasing, and the color appealing. I wasn't able to mix it for the full 9 minutes as children will not be ignored for 9 seconds, but it turned out wonderful. I didn't cook it for quite the full 20 mins (17-18 mins made it a beautiful dark gold color) It's a very impressive bread to have come out of your oven as it looks very ""authentic."" UPDATE:  I just tried this as a pizza dough.  For the first rising, I shaped it very flat by using a spatula to spread it in parchment paper.  A little goes a long way toward a thick crust!  I put sauce on the raw dough and baked for 5 mins, then added toppings and baked another 6-7 mins.  This made the crust a little doughy.  Next time, I will spread it very thin and bake it without sauce until it becomes very pale gold, then add sauce and toppings all at once and bake for another 5 mins.  My DH is a huge fan of this bread, and said that it was as enjoyable to eat as the toppings, which is a nice change of pace!  This is also easier to mix up than some pizza doughs I've tried.  It made a wonderful crust, crunchy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside, with delightful flavor of its own.",2005-07-25T18:14:42Z,2005-07-25T18:14:42Z

Omitted the sausage, browned the garlic (being a garlic lover, I actually used closer to 7 or so cloves) and onions in olive oil before adding the chicken broth.  After bringing to a boil, I added the tortellinis and let roll freely for about 5 minutes.  Then I tossed in the tomatoes and let it go till pasta was tender.  At the last moment, I threw in the basil and spinach and cooked until just wilted. Don't forget the Parmigiano-Reggiano!

Second time, I reduced the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon because my kids dont like cinnamon with  meat, it tasted too strong. As in other Mediterranean recipes, I substituted the cinnamon with Arab Levant ``baharat´´ spices, the mixture of which can be made from any internet recipe for baharat on the with cheap spices in your kitchen (or you can use any Mediterranean 7-spice combination as recommended by a Turkish store owner).  Then I added more water and simmered on very low heat till beef fell apart when pierced by a fork. Wonderful, exotic taste.  More water also diluted the spices a bit for those who are not particularly fond of exotic Arab food due to the strong Arab spices of cinnamon and nutmeg and people had a hard time deciphering which spices I used.

I added an extra 1 cup of chicken broth while cooking so I had enough liquid leftover when I added 1 cup of instant brown rice during the last 40 minutes turned on high.  It turned out yummy and we didn't have any leftovers!  Thanks for the recipe!",2004-04-21T21:06:20Z,2004-04-21T21:06:20Z

The only problem I had with the whole thing was that there isn't an oven temperature listed in the directions.  I baked this at 375 degrees F and it worked out fine.

The Pepperoncinis are a perfect touch, as they mellow as they cook, and they don't leave the meat spicy. Even better the next day when the flavors are allowed to blend.

I've made similar dishes with similar ingredients, but they've all used apple cider, so I was interested to see what using concentrated apple juice would do.  First, it makes a wonderful marinade - the pork took on a beautiful color and glaze, and the flavor definitely seeped into the meat because I could taste the subtle sweetness of it when I ate it.  The pork came out PERFECTLY.  The apple juice concentrate also provided a nice punch of apple flavor to the sauce, which was so good and so simple to eat!  I did substitute a white onion for the red onion, because my red onion disappeared for some reason, but other than that I stuck with the recipe, just halving the ingredients to make fewer portions.  My husband told me to give you 5 stars, and 5 stars you shall have.  We loved it, and will be making it again for sure!",2003-01-13T22:29:15Z,2003-01-13T22:29:15Z

93827,101706,88913,58104,Rita1652,3,As you see in the picture these are a very pretty pink. I thought braising the radishes would calm the bitterness but I find that they were more bitter. For the dry wine I used Vermouth. And I used yellow onion in place of the red. The recipe didn`t say to leave the radishes whole so I cut them in half. I think this would have been better if sliced. The cooking time was longer then 7 minutes I say closer to 15 minutes and still had a crisp crunch to them. If you like radishes like I do you should give Chia`s creamy radish slaw recipe #88912.

I think you could sugnificantly cut back on the margarine (maybe even eliminate it altogether) because the soup and sour cream mixture provides plenty of moisture.

It was very easy to make - I whipped it up after dinner the other night and the smell was incredibly good.  I did have to bake it longer than an hour (might be my oven).  It's very moist and delicious.  It keeps well in the refrigerator and I've been eating it every day (so much for my low carb diet!)  I think I'll try it with walnuts next time and there will be a next time!  This will be a great gift for next Christmas (I'll make small loaves) since it keeps so well.

I was unsure if I should swirl the cheese mixture into the batter, because this is the only way I've ever seen this type of brownie done.  Since the recipe did not say to swirl, I didn't.  I think I may try it next time, though, because although these are quite tasty, the top almost looks like macaroni and cheese.  The cheese mixture got a little brown and when I took them out of the oven (after only 30 minutes), my husband said ""I thought you were making brownies!""  I used a large brownie mix (for a 9x13 pan) and made it in a 8x10 pan (I do not own a 9 x 9 square pan).  I was not sure what size brownie mix, but when I saw the cooking time, I figured it was the larger package cooked in a small pan to produce a thicker brownie.

I have not worked a great deal with puff pastry and was unsure of how thin to roll it. Here in Canada we cannot buy sheets of Puff pastry ours come in a 395 Gram package  that are separated into 2 blocks - I separated each of the bocks into 3 equal pieces and rolled them out to apprx 1/8"" thickness (thiness?) then cut out the circles (I made 6 centimeter circles) - I took a shortcut here and placed each circle in a lightly oiled mini tartlet tins (apprx 1 1/4"" across and1/2"" deep.) Filled them and Voila it only took minutes to do all 40 of them. I did not use the egg. They puffed beautifully and were golden on the edges. The filling did not go dry - stayed a nice texture Served with a sweet chili sauce as suggested and all that I put out disappeared very quickly  and there were  requests for the recipe. You are right make the day before & just pop them in the oven. I have saved  some baked and  put them in the freezer.  Thanks Dale for a great recipe Added comments 19 Oct 03 I took the frozen tartlets out of the freezer in the AM put them in the fridge for the day. Baked them at 375F for 15 miutes and they were perfect. Watch that  the bottoms do not burn - next time I will put them on a rack in a pan so some air can get under.

This is a very easy recipe. I followed it closely--except I substituted all the dairy with low- or no-fat versions in the sauce. It never did smooth out, but I decided not to worry about it, either. 

When I checked it after an hour with sauce, there was a surprising amount of water (defrosting the chicken in the pot didn't help matters). I put in some pasta, which soaked up a lot of the liquid. Half an hour later it was done, and recieved with honors! My family ate every bit, and asked for more.

My only complaint would be that the recipe was a bit off.  Right off the bat I knew that 1 tbsp of salt would be too much.  So I added 1 tsp. and it was perfect.  I also added 2 1/2 tsp of yeast instead of 1 1/2.  I was worried that me changing the recipe a bit would mess it up, but the bread came out PERFECT.  Also, the recipe doesnt specify whether to chop the walnuts, or use them whole.  I chopped them.  And lastly, after baking the bread and tasting it, it was a bit sweet, so I would cut the sugar down a few tbsps.

3936,6449,16245,6357,Charishma_Ramchanda,3,"These cookies were something different. But, I'd like to make a few suggestions based on how I made them today.
Firstly, on mixing the dry ingredients with the butter-oil mixture, I didn't get a soft dough. What I got was something similar to ""boondis"" i.e., small round balls. I made these into round balls(just like we make ladoos) and then baked them for 24 minutes. Once these were cooled, I dipped them in the topping.
For the topping, I suggest to heat sugar and water together and once the sugar has melted, to add the honey. Allow to simmer for 2-3 minutes.
Then, dip the cooled cookies into this syrup and after removing from the syrup, arrange in a serving tray/dish and then sprinkle with nuts.
Initially, I made the topping as the recipe says, but the problem was that the whole thing hardened up within seconds and made it very difficult for me. That's why I came up with the idea mentioned above. 
Another thing, I could make only 1 dozen cookies and not 3 dozen as per the measurements mentioned in this recipe.
Overall, it was okie, something different from usual cookies.",2001-12-27T13:35:21Z,2001-12-27T13:35:21Z

A wonderful Asian recipe.  I am impressed with the limited number of ingredients,  simplicity in preparation, and precious little cook-time.  It meant I could socialize longer with my guests,  before meal time.   I am not very familiar with Asian recipes and do not cook them often, (except for stir-fry),  because I don't like making errors.  However, this recipe persuaded  a second look; I shall rethink and delve more closely into ""East Meets West"" cuisine.  There is much to be learned, and I am not  above learning new things.  

Of necessity, I used  ""diabetic"" brown sugar at the initial marinating stage (Step 2), and the results were quite good.  The moisture from the BEEF RIBS blends well with the sugar to create a lovely sweet sauce.  The resulting infusion of sweetness throughout the BEEF RIBS is a pleasant surprise.  I often wondered how this was achieved and always assumed it to be by injection.  Of course, the final marinating process is the ""piece-de-resistance"" (Step 4).  I reduced the amount of cayenne pepper  flakes by  half  and doubled the grated ginger  (I love ginger).  This was purely personal preference;  found it to be a sufficient amount of ""heat"" for my taste and did not compromise the originality of the recipe. 

I am a great believer in the ""sniff-n-taste"" cooking method.  The sniffing was fine, but  the taste of the liquid marinade (step 4) was a bit suspect, in that,  it tasted heavily of soy sauce.  However, I did my lesson well and spread this marinade onto the BEEF RIBS, as instructed.  The result was once again a delightful surprise.  The sweetness from (Step 2), toned down  the harshness of the soy sauce mixture (Step 4) to a wonderful blend of flavour.  This combination created wonders in tenderizing the meaty BEEF RIBS.  Cooking for 5 minutes, each side was perfect.  The BEEF RIBS were tender, rare, flavourful,  and juicy.

As luck would have it, one of the local supermarkets had a BBQ feature  this week; beef short ribs, (and shoulder lamb chops for another recipe)   AHA!!!  I am a sucker for a bargain, so, I bought 10 lbs of  BEEF SHORT RIBS,  increased the recipe accordingly,  to serve plenty for 10 people, with no left-overs.  This recipe was a delicious main course, barbeque meal,  this afternoon, washed down with plenty of  good old Canadian beer.   Of course, diabetes prevents me from enjoying this good old brew, but does not prevent me from serving it to my guests, in copious amounts, along with your wonderful ASIAN GRILLED SHORTRIBS. Side dishes included plain boiled rice, sliced pickled ginger, mixed greens, and  lots of serviettes, hand-wipes and lemony finger bowls.  Everyone was sucking bones and licking fingers.  Lip-smacking good.    I have filed a printed copy on my cooking board, in a section  I call ""NewFoundRecipes - DoAgain""  

This recipe gets well-deserved full marks...  Thanks so very much for sharing your talent and enticing me into cooking an Asian recipe.

Not like bbq brisket but more like a tangy sweet flavor.  My family thoroughly enjoyed it.  I used a 7.5 lb brisket.  To marinade overnight i used about 3 TBS of liquid smoke and sprinkled the meat liberally with onion powder, garlic salt, and celery salt.  I DOUBLED the recipe for br. sugar, mustard and garlic as i had such a large piece of meat.  It did not specify how much water to use for the brown sugar only enough to make a liquid so i used 1 cup and it did make alot, (will probably use 3/4c. water next time).  At first i thought it was way to much liquid b/c it came a little over halfway up the brisket  but i wanted to follow the recipe exactly so i could rate it.  I cooked it exactly as it said only i left it in one more hour @350 b/c my brisket was bigger.  Yummy so glad i tried this one.  This will be a regular here at our house.  Forgot to put in potatoes but will use next time. If you are making a smaller brisket follow the recipe exactly it is perfect.

Also found the curry to be a bit runny for our likes at the finish, so added a couple of tablespoons of ground almonds thicken a little-no real change in flavour, but thicker with a nice texture.

However it didn't rise for me, turning out only a centimetre or two higher than the original level of the batter. I will try it again soon and let you know how I go. UPDATE : made this again and same problem, it just did not rise.  I had my oven pre-heated and followed the directions closely.  RecipeObsession perhaps you could make your recipe again, paying attention to each step you do and see if you could add some more precise directions - should it be well beaten during mixing or just stirred together?

The sauce made 1 1/3 cups and I reserved 1/2 cup to stir fry with. If you were to use just veggies this would probably be just the right amount.

I had the potato mixture all ready a couple of hours before dinner then just before baking I added the baking powder to mixture and got it into the oven. It rises beautifully, and looks nice, and tastes really light and airy. This recipe is certainly a keeper.

I was really intrigued that you included directions for a frozen breast, because I always seem to have one hanging out in the freezer (I forget to thaw it of course). I plunged gamely ahead. My crockpot is too small of course, but no matter. I oiled the outside, and also salted & peppered the outside (instead of under the skin, which was, of course, frozen to the breast). Added the garlic & onion. Discovered that the lid wouldn't go on, so I wrapped the top in foil, tucking it down between the crock & the outside, and perched the lid on top. I let it go about 10 hours on low, because I was a bit lazy about making the fixings. The result? A beautifully cooked turkey, moist, tender, and infused with a lovely hint of onion & garlic.

83295,90637,42641,101275,Girl from India,5,I make this salad and it is really lovely. Have no clue what picante sauce is though. I use tomato juice and a little vinegar instead of the lemon juice and chopped garlic in the dressing with the rest of the ingredients. Use olives and roasted almond too as garnish and yellow and red peppers and a little cucumber and yes fresh corn kernel boiled in salt water and no avocado which is not easily found around here and if found is a little over my budget. Heck! I feel like I have hijacked the recipe but I mean well as I do love this salad. Was about to post it myself but ran a check and found yours :)Fay,2004-02-26T10:40:26Z,2004-02-26T10:40:26Z

I agree with the first reviewer, Carol, that these are for sure a crisp cookie that is great with tea/coffee. I used all the ingredients in the recipe, except that I substituted the shortening with margarine. I baked at 180C for 30 minutes. I made just 1 batch of 6 huge cookies(I dropped a tbsp. of the cookie mixture into the greased baking tray and so, the cookies that resulted were giant sized) :)
My 6 huge cookies are equivalent to 12-14 smaller ones. I have to run now to make another batch and another until I use up all the mixture. This makes a whole LOT of cookies:)

It worked ok, but think it would have been smoother and creamier with the chunk.  Also, dd had bought the dried alredo pasta with basil and garlic in it.  It was very good!  dh was miffed because he missed it, so 2 nites later I made it again at home.

I reduced the amount of salt to 1 tsp and added 2 tsp beef bouillon granules. I also added two extra cups of water. Kim127, I can see why this is your favorite chili recipe.

Sorry, maybe it's a Texas thing but we like our dishes seasoned and I thought it would be hot but we couldn't taste it. Ended up tossing it. Sorry, again obviously a difference of opinion and taste.

that´s why I decided to make this bread. But the thing is that it didn´t turned out as I expected... I followed exactly the recipe. I used green olives stuffed with garlic, my favorites. I tried very hard not to overmix the dough. The final texture was quite compact, not at all like any bread I ever had but more like yellow cake. The color was very yellowish also, probably because of the 2 eggs. The crust was quite hard, so it tended to crumble and break when I cutted or handled it. The taste was strange because it tasted too sweet and not enough salted, even with the olives on, so this impression helped to feel that I was eating a sort of a dessert cake instead of a bread, so if I ever do this again, I´ll add more salt, at least 1 teaspoon, and I will reduce the amount of sugar to 1 teaspoon as well... 
 I made it for dinner and it lasted more or less fresh until the next evening. Then it got a stale taste and a dry and compact texture, and I decided to throw away the leftover... so as ChrissyO said, it was best fresh from the oven.
 I will maybe make it again, if I can figure out what changes I should make to adapt it more to my taste, but not soon, because we really didn´t liked it...  ",2003-11-05T10:14:39Z,2003-11-05T10:14:39Z

79012,86143,58160,23302,Millereg ,5,"Absolutely first freakin' class! I followed the recipe to a T. (Well, OK, I have to fess up that I did add several drops of chipotle Tabasco to the sauce recipe). The flavours of the spices were very noticeable and distinct, while not being overpowering. A couple of comments, though: first, even though I filled each tortilla with over 1/4 cup of the cheese/onion mixture, I got 16 enchiladas and still had almost 1/2 pound of the cheese mixture left over - it did NOT go to waste however as I sprinkled it over the top of the enchiladas right before baking and the result was a fantastic bubbly gooey cheese topping. Second, while the sauce was absolutely delicious, there was insufficient liquid to smother the enchiladas in the baking dish because the liquid had reduced quite a bit during the simmering process, and so I had to make about another cup and a half of the sauce (without adding any more meat) and that worked out just fine. I will certainly use the sauce part of this recipe again for another purpose, namely to use it in my own ""Sunken Meat Burritos"" recipe. Since there are only two of us, an added bonus was that there were plenty of leftovers for another meal or two. Overall, this recipe is restaurant quality - thank you so much for sharing it.",2004-01-27T20:10:56Z,2004-01-27T20:10:56Z

So why not 5 stars? Well…I cut back the yeast to 1 tablespoon, and 1 tablespoon yeast was definitely sufficient. It is true that it is very hot and humid here now, so the 1 1/2 tablespoons (2 packages) of yeast might be fine when the weather is cold. I also would have liked to have had clearer instructions on how to shape the buns more attractively. I often make yeast breads and can make balls of dough with no problem. But when I snipped the tops with scissors in a cross, the balls opened out and ended up almost squared-off on top. Another small item is the amount of water to mix with the egg yolk. 2 teaspoons? 1 tablespoon? This, I can guess, but I think inexperienced cooks might have trouble with it.

I used frozen corn instead of cob.. didn't have enough clam juice and substituted 1 c. chicken stock instead.  Also, opted to add an additional cup.

I really thought the rice especially was very good - I did use saffron but reduced the heat by cutting the cayenne by half (I was serving to a child).  It baked up rich and tender and was very attractive.  The chicken was also quite flavorful, although I think the 20 minute browning time was a bit too long - some pieces were a little too dry.  Next time, I would probably cut the browning time in half.  I also wished the peas had been cooked with the rice - they remained colorful by adding them at the end, but didn't have the rich flavors of the other veggies that had been cooked with the rice.

They didn't run so far when I put the food on the table, though, did they?  I didn't have any Italian sausage so used some Moroccan mergez sausage.  It gave an added spicy flavor.  I pureed it all in a food processor (without the bones, of course) and then just strained the sauce for ""bits"".  I served this over beef goulash cubes on egg noodels.

If I had sealed it in jars and let it mellow for a week or two I think the flavors would blend more but it was good the same day too. I cut the recipe back to one third and the lemon flavor was a bit strong also there was not enought moisture to simmer it for 30 minutes so I added 2 tbsp of water at a time - this worked well.  The moisture amount may have been affected by cutting the recipe back but I recommend that you watch it carefully so it does not burn.

Not a trace left!) so it might be better to just make a little puddle for dipping rather than just pouring the syrup on top.  Super easy, super fluffy- super good.  These freeze well too, so next time I think I'll make a double batch and just freeze the leftovers for many joyous breakfasts to come.  Don't worry about how thick the batter is- just be sure to spread it out with your spoon.

I feel the prosciutto/parm/rosemary/garlic mix is the star of this recipe, and changing the cut of meat is unimportant.  That mixture is so tasty, I ate a spoonful as I was preparing it.  I didn't finely chop everything - I'm far too lazy - I pulsed it all together in the food proc to form a paste.  I think this will be on our Easter table next Sunday, this time w/a tenderloin.

49429,54954,52300,89148,Sandra Gosline,2,The basic idea of this recipe is very good but I needed to modify it quite a bit.  The recipe calls for garlic but does not say when to put it in.  (I chose to saute it with the leeks and onions the last 3 minutes of cooking them.)  The recipe also does not say how much pressure to cook the roast on.  (I chose 15lbs of pressure.)  I did not have a pressure cooker that had a pan to put the roast in while cooking.  (Do they make these?)  I put the roast directly into the sauce and cooked it for 35 minutes with good results.  The rub is wonderful and I may use the rub in a separate recipe on it owns next time.  This is a good basic recipe but have tested better ones.,2003-06-08T13:33:18Z,2003-06-08T13:33:18Z

I also threw in a garlic clove that was sitting on the counter and used the French puy lentils as suggested. They retained a nice texture that contrasted well with the rice.

84794,92202,45246,59686,Cindi M Bauer,4,"This was a good recipe.  I baked this in a 2 1/2 quart rectangular baking dish for 35 minutes, but first I sprayed the baking dish with a vegetable spray.  Next, I added the (not crushed) boxed stuffing mix, which I already mixed with the melted butter.  I then mixed both the cream of celery
and cream of chicken soup together,
with the apple juice.  I spread most of this over the stuffing, but
saved enough of the soup to top each piece of chicken with at least
2 Tablespoons.  I placed the chicken ontop, and spooned the 2 Tbsp. of the soup mixture on top of each piece.  I layed 2 slices of the swiss cheese over each piece of chicken before baking, but the next time, I'm going to add it near the end of the baking time, so it won't brown too much.  Note: The brand of swiss cheese I used was, the Crystal Farms (it's kind of like the Kraft cheese slices).  The next time I'm going to try slices of smoked swiss cheese instead. Our Walmart store has some good smoked swiss cheese in their deli.  I think the cream of broccoli soup, and the cheddar cheese soup mixed together for this recipe, sounds good too. This recipe reminds me of either the Betty Crocker Oven Bakes, or the Campbell's Classic Dinner Bakes you'll find at the grocery store.
Thanks for the recipe Darlene.

The ricotta would not blend in and stayed in little lumps, which is probably the fault of it being too firm a ricotta perhaps, so be sure to use a soft one. The lumps were not offputting however and were quite tasty and cheesey.
The main problem I had was the first few pancakes were like hard flat lumps, not the least bit fluffy, wouldn't cook properly and were quite dissapointing (I still ate them, tasted O.K). I added some baking powder to the remaining mix and the remaining pancakes turned out perfect and fluffy.

I did make a change to the method, however.  My shortening and sugar was more like coarse crumbs until I began adding the eggs.  As a result, I added the bananas and then the cranberry sauce prior to adding the dry ingredients.  I think the secret to a tender quick bread is not to overwork the batter, and I felt trying to fold in the heavy cranberry sauce after the flour would over work it.  I also think it dispersed the cranberries much more evenly this way.

I seasoned with about 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and the taste was really out of this world. It was rich and cheesy. My only comment about the finished product is that it was runny. I did drain the hominy and the chiles really well, too. Next time I might try adding a little rice or maybe even an egg as a binder. It did thicken a bit after it cooled, though. Great recipe! Oh - and if you do make this for a pot luck, I might suggest that you double the recipe.

Made your recipe for dinner yesterday and it turned out super-great, as well as easy to make.  Our guests thoroughly enjoyed the chicken with the sauce.  I served the chicken over my Special 5 Rice Combination topped with crushed cashews.
I also used chicken wings and fried them separately, then added them to the sauce before serving.  I have passed this recipe to several of my friends who enjoy good and tasty recipes.  Will be making this recipe often.

I should have peeked at them sooner, but didn't want all the steam to be released. It also dried out a bit so I would suggest a generous drizzle of olive oil rather than a dash. The flavor was nice, I would have liked them to taste more like they were cooked on the barbecue, and I think the foil prevents that flavor from entering.

I'd like a stronger lime flavor, as opposed to the orange, so I think I would up the lime and reduce the orange next time.  But this is a good light recipe and I would make it again.

After initially making it and serving the very first slices, the rest of it fell apart very badly.  We definitely couldn't add any type of spreads to it, even butter.

87506,95067,19321,128693,Kzim4,5,We love this dessert. The crust has a nutty flavor without the nuts (great for me since I am sensitive to them). I have also made this recipe using chocolate pudding in place of the lemon with great success. I usually let the pudding layer set for about 5 minutes in the fridge before I put the Cool whip over the top to avoid mixing the two.,2004-03-25T06:15:18Z,2004-03-25T06:15:18Z

I took Annelies advice, since my machine is also European, and can't be opened once it starts.  We have a front loader, and the only problem I had was that I must have bought bleach with soap, because it really started sudsing up in the drum.  At one point it started leaking out the sides of the door (which was shut tight) and then the bubbles started coming out of the detergent dispenser on top.  I quickly turned the machine to the spin and drain cycle.  I was able to run the vinegar wash straight through with no problems.  Next time I'll make sure there is no soap in my bleach!  I figure if I do this every 6 months or so I should have no problem with gray and smelly laundry!  Thanks Bev, this is a jewel of a recipe!",2003-06-18T03:24:45Z,2003-06-18T03:24:45Z

I know this will be made next Passover.  The directions were very easy to follow and the heads up about cooking too long is appreciated.  I used jellyroll pans and maybe could have used a bit more of the caramel mixture but did just fine with what I had.  I used a pizza cutter to cut it into pieces while still warm.

Now, I marinate in the foil, don't use any oil at all except to spritz the foil with to make it non-stick, and use slices of lemon instead of juice set on top.  I put the packets together in the morning, let them sit all day and then bake and they taste WONDERFUL.

It takes quite a while for the butter to brown (can't remember exactly but about 10 minutes at least), and the bubbles never did go away completely.  
I used a 9 1/2"" tart pan.  I overcooked my first tart (because the pears shrank away from the filling upon cooling), but the second time at 1 hour was perfect. 
The best thing about this tart, apart from the fun you have making it, and its appearance, is the really wonderful taste. 
There is a picture on the internet of this tart so you know what you are aiming for. That was really helpful too.   Next time I'm going to try this with mangoes.  ",2002-12-11T09:43:21Z,2002-12-11T09:43:21Z

I made two version though. With the green olives, instead of the Cheeze Whiz which is a bit too salty to go with the green, I threw about 3/4th of a cup of velveeta chunks in my food processor with about a tablespoon of milk and blended until it was smooth but a bit thicker than Cheese Whiz would be. I also substituted 1/8 garlic powder instead of the garlic salt. Then used about 14 olives chopped. It's the olives that should supply the salt here, so taste and add. Wonderful with water crackers. The kids liked it with Ritz crackers.
For the other one I used black olives. I whipped together about 1/2 cup of cheese whiz with 1/2 cup Velveeta. I only used a tsp of the worchestershire but used the garlic salt and a 1/8-1/4 tsp of seasoning salt to taste. Great!",2002-01-19T13:16:19Z,2002-01-19T13:16:19Z

I do think the 8-hour cooking time may be a little long for some crockpots -- mine was done when I checked it after 4 hours. I love the heat, but I used half cayenne pepper and half Chinese Five Spice to cut down on the heat factor for the more timid tastebuds in our family.

86219,93704,86768,35701,ciao4293,5,"taylortwo is so right about this frosting! If you're looking for thick, creamy and fudgy, as well as easy, this one is it! I've made it twice already, since tt told me about it. First time with Ghirardelli chips, second with Baker's semisweet. After just having the last piece of the cake with the baker's frosting, I have to say that I liked it better with the chocolate chips. It was more on the rich chocolate side, and improved daily. But surprisingly, they were VERY close! I didn't think it would be nearly as good with Baker's, but it really was. This frosting is a dream to spread on a cake. The first time, I did have to reheat it on low for a few seconds at a time--just put the pan back on the heat, give it about 5 secs or so, and it's nice and soft again. Your cake will be beautiful and glossy with this one, in fact, I think it would be near impossible to make a cake look bad with this. It has it all, ease of prep, great flavor, good looks, AND it's usually stuff you already have on hand. Way more than 5 stars, for sure. Thanks tt, this is the only frosting I'm making from now on!  DON'T FORGET!!  You MUST sift the powdered sugar, or your frosting will be lumpy--do not skip this step to save time.

Remember to check if the cheese is soaking in brine and be prepared to pop it in some fresh water to get rid of some of the salt. I recommend real Mediterranean cheese as I tried doing a similar recipe with some Australian halloumi and it began to melt on me. The real thing holds up to the frypan in a much more convincing way.

Normally, when I eat sloppy joes I put them on both sides of the bun, top with parmesan cheese, and eat it openfaced with a fork and knife.  Not these! They held together really well and I was able to eat them without the joes dripping out the sides of the bun.  It's a keeper!

I did make some changes:  I did not have cream of chicken soup, so I used Campbells Fiesta Nacho soup and half teaspoon poultry seasoning then used less shredded cheese; instead of consomme (what's that?) I used chicken broth; I also used my favorite salsa instead of the taco sauce listed.  This meal is HUGE--serves more than eight, more like 16.  Serve with a simple lettuce and tomato salad.  I would have given this recipe five stars, but my darling four-year-old, with boring taste buds, thought this was too spicy.

These were such a hit with both kids and adults, and so quick and easy, that they will be made again, and I can't wait to try the chocolate version in the cookbook. For my lemon cakes, I made a fluffy lemon buttercream type frosting, but next time I will try a thinner, smoother icing, as above. (In the cookbook, ""Instant Royal Icing"" is recommended.)

I have never made Swiss Steak in a crockpot before.  I always did mine in the oven.  Your recipe is fantabulous, superb and also, oh-so-delicious.  The sauce or gravy was excellent, and so tasty. Unfortunately, the ratings don't go high enough.
I did make some additions as follows: 
I use 3 times the amount of flour and increased the spices accordingly.  Added 1 teaspoon of chili powder, 1 - 10 ounce can of mushroom bits & pieces along with the liquid, and increased the red wine to 1/2 cup.
I could not get any beef round steak, so I purchased Beef Sirloin Steak.  Did everything else as per your recipe and cooked it for 8 hours.  The meat was so tender that you did not have to cut it with a knife, it actually almost fell apart by itself.
I served this along with Basmati rice and WOW!!
What a keeper this is to cook it in the crockpot.

44809,50119,48637,35193,GinnyP,5,"chia, these were terrific!  Our experience was (I say 'our' because dh and I did this together) this:  We had oysters that had an obvious 'cup' side and 'flat' side.  We grilled them over high heat with the 'cupped' side down, with the intention that the oyster would remain in the cupped side which would lend itself to holding the juices and then the butter mixture.  It took a little more than the 5 minutes for the shells to open and most were stuck to the flat side even though the oysters were attached to the cupped side. (Next time we'll try it opposite)  They were cooked enough by the time they opened, so we placed them on a plate lined with rock salt to give them a steady 'seat' and then spooned the butter mixture over them while they were still hot.  Dh had heavy duty gloves to remove the shells while I held the dish with the salt and the discard bowl for the top shells.  Then I put the butter mixture over.  The oysters didn't all open at once so we didn't feel harried.  We let them sit while dh grilled a pepper-crusted ahi fillet (which took about 4 minutes) and they were an excellent complement to our dinner.  I would have these anytime!  Also, I made the butter mixture a little ahead of time.  It looked like the mixture was turning kind of solid and I thought about reheating it.  All it took was a good brisk stirring and the mixture melted nicely over the oysters.  I don't know for sure, but since there are many varieties of oysters, grill time/techniques may vary.  And lastly, I used Cakebread Cellars Chardonnay 2001 which is dry with a prominent oak flavor, and about a quarter cup of chopped fresh parsley.  chia, I make these lengthy comments as much for myself for future reference as I do to give feedback. This is one we plan to have all oyster season long!  Thank you for sharing this!
P.S. This was our first time having oysters at home!  Success!",2003-04-22T22:22:30Z,2003-04-22T22:22:30Z

While the filling mixture was mixing in the mixer, I prepared the rest of the ingredients.  By time the filling was done (20 minutes), I had the crust made, the pineapple dejuiced and the bananas peeled (I used 5), sliced and dipped in lemon juice. This was so easy to make and DELICIOUS! It looked so good that after 2 hours chilling, the gang at work dug in.  Everyone is raving about how good it is.  And, it really does taste like a banana split minus the ice cream.

I will reduce the barley to 1/4th cup next time and add more celery and mushrooms and double the wine and beef broth.
One helpful fact I noted in my Rival Crock-Pot booklet was the ability to make a recipe the night before and store it in the ""removable"" stoneware container in the refrigerator, covered with pastic wrap, with no change in cooking time.

The beans and basil overpowered the sutle taste of the walnuts and they ended up as just a flavoring.  Maybe Bead Dip with Walnut flavor would be a better name.  I probably won't make this again as walnuts are expensive to use in a chip dip and the flavor wasn't worth the price.",2003-02-08T05:48:48Z,2003-02-08T05:48:48Z

it was fairly quick to cook, but it took me longer than 15 minutes to prep.  getting the chix washed, trimmed and pounded took some time.  i couldn't prep the sauce while the chix browned because browning went quickly and needed my attention.  next time, i'll prep it all early in the day.  we all really enjoyed this fresh dish!

I buy the mix blended but not ground. I ground it minutes before use. The stock was quite thick and gelatinous so to make up for the lack of liquid I used 2 cups of home made tomato sauce instead of paste. I thought the 7-bone might need a bit more cooking so I let it go for 2 1/2 hours in the oven. It was perfect! I served it with Spanish Rice, hot Corn Tortillas, and a nice Sangria.

36636,41527,22133,6357,Charishma_Ramchanda,5,"This is a ""real good"" cake - its nutty, smells wonderful, got fresh fruit, is soft and incredibly tasty! It is very similar to one of Mirj Mom's cakes that used ginger and apple in it. I loved the taste of ginger in particular that stands out at the end - thats, ""To die for"". I did make a few substitutions, though. I used light brown sugar instead of dark brown, as I had only light brown on hand. Also, I didn't have nutmeg on hand, and I substituted it with cinnamon. Pecans out here cost a fortune, and, I substituted those with almonds. Everything worked well. This cake took 1 hour 40 minutes to bake in my AMC Dutch oven. To make this cake slightly guilt-free, I used low-fat milk in which I added lemon juice(prepared this as a substitute for buttermilk). Everything else was perfect.
I would recommend this recipe to everyone. It's my uncle's(mom's younger brother's) birthday today, and while my dad, bro. and the rest of our larger family is celebrating on my uncle's huge lawn, we decided to have a small cake and samosas here, just to keep the mood up(Everyone was low as India lost against Australia in the World Cup today), and, just to put a little smile on their faces, I baked them this cake. The guys who work with dad loved this(I packed some for their families). I've saved one huge helping for my dad and bro. to dig into when they get back home on the 19th:)

67862,74464,49160,58104,Rita1652,4,Thw Wild mushrooms with the port and cream were just wonderful. Rich and full of flavor. I just wasn`t crasy about the chicken being cooked on top of the mushrooms. The plain chicken juices ran onto the mushrooms. It would have been ok if the juices are clear but it lets out the white liquid.I think this would have been great if the seasoned chicken was grilled or broiled then placed on top of the mushrooms. I will make again because I did enjoy the Mushrooms they were great.,2003-11-07T08:51:47Z,2003-11-07T08:51:47Z

The only modification that I made was to add a little melted butter to the crumbs, and I sprinkled a small amount of garlic powder over the crumb/parmesan topping (I used unseasoned Italian crumbs).

I put them in the oven when no one was around and the kitchen light was off.  My husband, a photographer, found them iiluminated in the kitchen oven and started photographing them.  He developed the pictures before everyone arrived and we all got a kick out of how the chickens looked in the oven (I made 2).  Well they tasted as great as they looked and the consensus was that they were finger licking good.  My family doesn't usually like the skin on the chicken, but this was too good to pass up.  I did encounter one problem and that was that one chicken fell over halfway through and it wasn't so easy to get him upright again.",2002-12-24T06:06:02Z,2002-12-24T06:06:02Z

I used The Cake Bible method as I'm more comfortable with the consistancy that it yeilds: Mix eggs and yolks with 1/4 of the sour cream and the vanilla extract.  Sift the dry ingredients into the bowl of a mixer,  run the mixer on low for a couple minutes,  add the butter and 3/4 of the sour cream.   Mix on low until combined then on medium speed for 90 seconds, scrape,  add egg mixture in 3 increments,  mixing for 20 seconds after each addition.  I did not use the vanilla bean paste and it's not necessary.  The vanilla taste is intense,  maybe too strong for some.  This is a large cake,  with a great amount of dry ingredients.

7382,10272,20545,28846,Caryn,0,"Just to note:  The intent of the recipe is for the bacon fat to render out and spill over the potatoes while they baking thus creating a crispy outer layer to the potatoes and crisp bacon strips.  Bacon that has already been cooked would not provide the bacon fat necessary to coat the potatoes so that they become crispy on the outside nor would it provide the flavor.  Another possible alternative, though I have not tried this, would be to toss the potatoes in the bacon fat rendered out from the cooked bacon.  Place the potatoes on the baking sheet and place the cooked bacon on top.  The only problem with this method is that the bacon would more than likely burn.",2002-03-18T10:44:28Z,2002-03-18T10:44:28Z

I followed the amount of ingredients and instructions without any alterations, using the crushed pineapple.  I found two things I would do differently the next time.  I would use two cups of crushed pineapple instead of one to enhance the pineapple flavor.  With only one cup it had the wonderful light fluffy taste of an egg custard and not quite enough pineapple taste.  I also found that after the 40 minute cooking time was up, the middle of the pie was no where near set but the edges were getting very brown.  I covered the edges with aluminum foil and had to bake for another 40 minutes before it set.  I will have to check my oven as the temperature may be off.

72450,79265,78123,40620,Narshmellow,5,"At first I was a little skeptical about cinnamon and honey in chili but I thought, overall it sounds pretty good and something new to try. I did make a few variations solely for not liking an ingredient or that it wasn't spicy enough. 1. I traded mild green chilies for the jalapenos (mot big on jalapenos). And after tasting the chili I needed about double the amount of chili powder and cumin to the spiciness I like (since I didn't use jalapenos). and 2. I didn't add the garlic or bell pepper (personal preferences). That all said and done - my family scraped the cooking pot clean! Honestly I think it was the hint of sweetness in there. The cinnamon and honey really give it a wonderful little taste like nothing else. An excellent recipe that will be a family favorite! ",2003-12-14T15:20:32Z,2003-12-14T15:20:32Z

The recipe was unclear on the rice issue, sounded like you are suppose to use instant. I added one cup of cooked brown rice which was the right amount for my husband, nothing to ricey for him.  I drained some of the liquid off the meat mixture to saute the zucchini. I also added a little extra seasoning to the meat and then to the zucchini while cooking-dried garlic, oregano, basil, parsley, salt and pepper.  It was perfect.

I also left out the raisins, again, because the kids won't eat anything with ""bugs"" in it.  Doubled up on the pine nuts instead, you can never have too many pine nuts (budget permitting).

I sprinkled the top of the muffins with sugar in the raw.  I did not chop up the mandarin oranges but they broke up a bit when I stirred them into the batter.

I found this to be extremely fast easy to put together as well as an excellent use of little bits of ingredients you might have left over - the cooked rice, boiled eggs, etc.  I think you could certainly use any sort of leftover flaked, meaty fish if you didn't happen to have any haddock or cod.  I used a verygood quality smoked salmon that tasted heavenly in this.  The only drawback I found was the huge amount of butter - which made it too greasy. Next time, I would use half the butter called for in this, as the butter flavor was a bit too pronounced and it was oily.  Also - I tried this two ways, one with the spicy ingredients, and a mild version for my child.  Either way it was very tasty, but I preferred it with a bit of heat.",2002-12-14T05:14:39Z,2002-12-14T05:14:39Z

Cream of celery soup and mushrooms are a must (though my mom always made it with peas- which is good too). I added the full cup (and a generous one at that) of cheese into the casserole and topped it with crushed cracker crumbs instead (though I like crushed potato chips as well).  Really good!!! Thanks for posting this Tara- I will be making this again and again. I wonder how it would taste with chicken? Hmmmm....,2002-10-24T09:40:29Z,2002-10-24T09:40:29Z

I probably would not take the time and effort to make it again. I was really exhausted after trying to fix it also, because of the amount of time I was having to work on something to pull it all together. I never could get the mustard seeds to crush, so ended up using dry mustard which would have been easier to do at the beginning.

I cut the potatoes into very small dice (3/8""? - SMALL) and steamed them lightly a few minutes before using them. I haven't tried these with plain mashed potatoes, as I didn't want to take a chance they might be too thick or ""gummy."" The second time I made these, I used Ragu's ""Light White"" Alfredo-style sauce instead of red tomato sauce. Really good, also cuts the calories some! For serving, I spooned some of the sauce over the peppers. Only reason this recipe didn't get five stars is I reserve ""fives"" for the truly outstanding, unique dishes. This isn't necessarily all that special - but it's certainly a treat in the stuffed pepper genre. p.s. Be careful not to parboil the peppers too long. They may not need to be boiled at all, if you like them with a bit of texture; I prefer mine more cooked and easier to cut. But take it from me, it IS possible to boil them a little too long and have them overcooked and limp. Not that I'd know from experience or anything!  ;-D",2004-02-29T04:45:13Z,2004-02-29T04:45:13Z

85909,93374,39392,4470,Bergy,5,This gets a rave from me - - The cooking time in the oven was 4 minutes - I used the very large (11-17 size prawns) and stove top 3 minutes. When prawns are cooked just long enough they have a special terxture when you bite into them -These almost exploded!  Marinating overnight really infuses the flavor into the prawn without detracting from  their own taste.

I made these today for my cousin whose travelling back home tomorrow and for the guys who work with dad. EVERYONE loved these. I served these with hot tea this evening. Infact, I have plans now to make these for Sankranti next year(a festival we celebrate every year on 14th Jan when we must necessarily eat food made using sesame seeds and/or jaggery!) I halved this recipe and I did not use pistachios as I didn't have those on hand. I did use 1/4 cup warm milk(low-fat) in addition to the 3tbsps. mentioned here(Note that even though I halved the recipe, I did not halve the 3tbsps. of milk). Also, I did toss in the sesame seeds and honey into the egg-flour mixture in step 5 itself as the dough did seem to be very very dry. With honey being added(again, I did use 1/3 cup honey and didn't halve that) it became easy to knead the dough with my greased(with ghee) hands. These made 23 cookies for me( about an inch and a half or so in size). I baked these at 180C for 15 minutes in my oven that had been preheated at the same temperature. These came out beautiful! Oh, and yes, before baking these, I did drizzle honey on each cookie(a generous amt) and then baked them. They're a beauty and I enjoyed making them. Thanks for sharing, Angela!

62094,68414,19009,99443,Lynn in RI,5,"What I made is actually a variation on the recipe posted. It was so delicious, I'm writing a review before cleaning up the kitchen. I started with MizzNezz's recipe for the potato mixture then put cheese on the inside and corn flake crumbs (instead of flour) on the outside. Talk about heaven--even though I forgot to add the onion to the potato mixture. The recipe as posted sounded very tasty, but I am trying to use up anything I can in anticipation of a move. With too much Edam cheese on hand--like over 4 lbs. of a 5 lb. ball--I decided to make one thin potato cake, about 3/8"" thick, put about 1/4"" of Edam slices over it to about 1/3"" of all edges, then make another 3/8"" thick cake as a top and seal it with the bottom. Originally planning to encase the cheese filled potato cakes with bread crumbs, I remembered I had an unopened box of Kellogg's corn flake crumbs and decided to use them instead of flour. I really pushed the corn flak crumbs into the top and bottom so there would be a nice crust. Out of bacon drippings, I fried them in a combination of oil and butter. Wow! Cruncy, smooth, and cheesy.  I served them with steak but in all seriousness, we could have made a meal just out of those potato cakes (had I cooked more). Now for what I did wrong, besides forgetting to use the onion: 1. I made the potato cheese cakes too big to easily cook, about 6"" long and 3 1/4"" wide.  Turning them in the pan became a real two spatula task due to the size. One totally fell apart. Next time I'm going to make them smaller. 2. I didn't pay close enough attention to the recipe and used about 4 *tablespoons* of butter instead of 4 *teaspoons.* That extra butter did make the flavor nice, but the more butter one adds, the harder any potato cake, with or without cheese, is to turn over in a pan without falling apart. For a note on cheese: If I hadn't had too much Edam on hand, I would have used cheddar, which is definitely my favorite cheese. As the recipe turned out, I think Edam just might be the perfect cheese for this potato mixture enclosure. Really, it was heaven in the mouth.",2003-09-21T18:06:17Z,2003-09-21T18:06:17Z

I made a bottle of this (added a little water and less cheese to make it thinner) and the whole family ate salad like it was going out of style...I didn't even put any vegetables in it (just plain romaine lettuce), but a few croutons would have been perfect. 

Very zesty and not for the faint of palate--my mom makes it with less anchovy paste since she's not a big fish lover--less garlic would tone it down also, but I loved it like this.  Thanks Evelyn!",2003-12-06T13:37:21Z,2003-12-06T13:37:21Z

Of course, I can't leave a recipe alone and had to make a few changes, but I used this recipe as the base and don't feel that my changes have really altered the recipe.  First, I used 2 mashed cloves of garlic instead of the garlic salt.  As I don't combine meat with dairy for religious reasons, I also used a vegetable broth instead of beef broth.  Aside from that, I stayed true to the rest of the recipe.  My kids had them with breadcrumbs, I had them without.  Dornette #3, who is a soup maven, had two bowls of this stuff on Friday night.  Dornette #1, a newbie vegetarian who usually doesn't eat soup, pronounced this delicious and took the recipe back with her to make at home.

I think it simmered around 3 hours, and it turned out great!  It might have been even better if I weren't so wine-ignorant - didn't know what bottle to buy.

Like Mirj, I've really enjoyed Inez' recipes and will be making more of them.  Unfortunately, also like Mirj, I had the same problems.  I ended up making it a second time and still was not satisfied with the results.  Both times I made the recipe as is, but the second time, I baked it sooner as it was mentioned in the discussion that it should not be allowed to raise beyond the top of the bread pan before beginning to bake.  It does have a delightful flavor and since I have a toaster/convection oven, I was able to work with the crumbliness the following day by toasting it (when I tried using the uncut loaf the following morning to make DH's sandwiches for work, it tended to crumble apart).  This is an extremely quick bread-making recipe so I really wish it would have worked out for me.

This was my first time to make Chimichurri sauce and we thought it had a wonderful spicy fresh flavor that was a good compliment to the beef. I might try grilling the patties next time just to see how that turns out. Thanks for another great recipe.,2003-03-28T13:21:07Z,2003-03-28T13:21:07Z

I followed the recipe exactly, except for omitting the onions in the actual meatballs (I added some garlic powder to the meat, too). Very easy to prepare.

This was an easy recipe to put together, with outstanding results, so yummy...another one of your winners Laudee, I will look forward to making this again...thanks Laudee for posting...KC :-)",2004-04-18T20:05:12Z,2004-04-18T20:05:12Z

I experimented by using pure lemon or almond extract as well,which definitely gave them a nice flavor.  I gave it four stars instead of five because I prefer a more dense, chewy cookie.  If you like a crunchy, melt-in-your-mouth type cookie, this one's for you.   ",2004-06-09T06:10:00Z,2004-06-09T06:10:00Z

I also added more cajun and some crushed red pepper, because we like things really spicy. My husband, who doesn't usually ""rave"" about anything, said that this was his new favorite meal. Thanks for a keeper! :)

I started with 3 cups cold, cooked rice which I heated in the microwave for 2 minutes.  Then added that to the scalded milk along with 2 T. butter and continued following your recipe.  It was easy and very delicious!",2003-02-09T04:48:36Z,2003-02-09T04:48:36Z

big hit.  It can be made the day
before, which is always nice to be
able to prepare something ahead of
time, but this is so easy to make

I'd had to write it out as I was out of ink and saved it....but didn't put it in my cookbook.  You can bet it's there now.  My grandkids loved this when I made it last weekend!  I even let them help :)  Next time I will have to make 2 of them at a time.  I followed your directions to the T, except on 1/2 the pie I added a can of diced green chilis...not hot chili's and used my own hand made pie crust. Both sides of the pie were really good!  I just like the flavor of the green chili's and add some to recipes as often as possible. This is my favorite sausage and I'm pleased to find another way to serve it! This pie will be served in our home quite often...thanks!...Kitty",2004-06-07T18:49:26Z,2004-06-07T18:49:26Z
97958,106019,30914,55655,Just Call Me Martha,5,"I had exactly ten minutes notice of impending company and happened to have most of these ingredients on hand. As I was pressed for time, I just threw everything into the food processor and zapped it a couple of times and it was perfect. I substituted sundried tomatoes for the pimentos, because that's what I had on hand. As I was in a pinch I microwaved it for a few minutes first and then popped it in the oven for about 10 minutes to brown up a bit. It was a hit! This is a great recipe and I will make it again in the future, using some of the garnishes suggested. Thanks Mysterygirl.",2004-06-02T11:22:03Z,2004-06-02T11:22:03Z

And no msg to give me a headache.  I made the soup exactly as written but I added a few fresh shrimp at the end.  Good addition!  I think the next time I make this soup, and I will be making it again, I will try leaving out the bell pepper since I'm not a big fan.  I'm picking out the pieces now and started to leave it out tonight but thought it might add something to the overall flavor of the soup.  I think some leftover shredded pork would be good in this soup also.",2004-01-17T17:59:54Z,2004-01-17T17:59:54Z
